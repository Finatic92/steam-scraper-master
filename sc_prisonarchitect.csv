2,crash,New hotfix for Windows deployed!,Jun 26,"Hello Wardens!We just published a new hotfix for the Windows edition to address several issues that you reported. We are still looking into solving more, and we plan to have another update coming next week. You can find the changelog and a list of some of the issues we are currently investigating at the end of this post. This hotfix will be published on Monday for Mac and Linux.We also saw several reports about the game generating areas with only water when purchasing new \\xe2\\x80\\x9cland\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on island prisons. With today\\\'s hotfix, the game will automatically generate new islands when you expand your prison. This is the first iteration of this tool, and we plan to improve in further iterations - in the meanwhile, please try it out and let us know what you think!Additionally, we are currently working on a couple of new features including a Quick Island Generation that allows players to draw a box and generate a new random island. This tool should help you to add more islands when expanding your land. We will have more information ready to share with you during the next week.Thank you all for your feedback!The Prison Architect TeamChangelog: New Feature: When expanding an Island Map, new islands will be generated, rather than empty sea.  The game will leave an empty area for existing shipping lanes. All the Island Bound assets are now showing in the Cheat/Debug mode. Solved pathfinding issues caused by Security Checkpoints. Fixed an issue that caused the game to crash when deploying a modded room. The game will no longer crash if you intake a corrupted Name In the Game Prisoner. Tyre Apparatus can now be rotated properly. Air Paramedics will now be able to leave the map if their Helicopter is dismissed. Criminally Insane prisoners will now properly attack trees when they acquire a weapon if they really have strong feelings against that tree. Fixed several localization issues for Traditional and Simplified Chinese.Currently investigated issues: Cooks not being as productive on Island Maps. Janitors having unexpected behaviors. Issues with logistics settings of Docks and Helipads"

If you have experienced a bug not already in this list, please let us know in this thread.Remember to include if you are using mods (and if you do, try to disable them - as sometimes they cause issues) and how to reproduce the bug you are experiencing.

Staff and inmates no longer do the eating animation.Fire engine spawns if dismissing fire brigade after dismissing helicopter.The Chinese edition still has half of English words.The Rock will not catch fire or take damage no matter what material or object it is.Stepping stones/pallets interferes with the pathing when trying to create a ferry line after removed.

Except that PA was a feature-complete game which was virtually bug-free after release. Introversion sell it to Paradox, and then it no longer is. PA is currently unplayable for many people right now. All of my saved prisons became unviable after the first update Paradox\\\'s third-party developer applied, as due to a \\\'bug\\\' they got filled with mentally-ill prisoners that could not be dealt with unless I purchased the Psych Ward DLC. KSP for all it\\\'s jank is an excellent game that has only ever seen tremendous improvement and deserves it\\\'s user ratinng."

And if I despite the bugged guards, the new ones came with the same issue, or, they move the prisoner but stay in their cell for ever.The second issue is that the cabinets of the visitation are crush, the prisoners go to the cabinet, take their time with their family, and then pass the cabinet, pass the wall that separetes the visitors from the prisoners, but they pass it with the cuffs on. This problem, added with the first on, just crash all my prison,Please, I need help."

For those who say that it will take a long time to resolve those bugs (3 1/2 years ) I think you are wrong. As I see it there are a lot of bugs duplicates or bugs that if they are fixed resolve multiple problems. Also I see there are lots of ""bugs"" that don\\\'t make any sense. For example ""Remove electrical chair from the game"" and this I think is a feature removal and not a bug. Also for those that say this is a big mess I think this was improved a lot over every alpha.

125,bug,New Patch coming next week!,Jul 10,"Hello wardens!As  mentioned last week, we are currently working on a new patch for Prison Architect to address several issues we saw reported, implement the new Island Creation tool, and do some bug fixing.We were initially planning to release the patch this week - but we assessed we need a bit more time to work on it to make sure it lives up to your expectations. We are currently looking at releasing it on Tuesday or Wednesday next week.Thank you all for your feedback and all the reports, rest assured that we are listening!

We are still looking into solving more, and we plan to have another update coming next week. You can find the changelog and a list of some of the issues we are currently investigating at the end of this post. This hotfix will be published on Monday for Mac and Linux.We also saw several reports about the game generating areas with only water when purchasing new \\xe2\\x80\\x9cland\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on island prisons. With today\\\'s hotfix, the game will automatically generate new islands when you expand your prison.

127,bug,Tonic_Ranger,Sep 23 @ 9:42am ,I used to play everyday back when introversion owned it (because the game actually worked then). Now I hardly play it anymore because of the amount of bugs and glitches there are. You can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even report bugs on Paradox\\xe2\\x80\\x99s twitch streams because they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t allow that and would rather you put them in the forums. But sometimes these reports don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even get noticed. Smh
128,bug,#6,Sep 23 @ 1:10pm ,myself I don\\\'t see any point on it. I think everyone already knows that Prison Architect is pretty buggy. Complaining here is not going to do anything about it. It\\\'s just useless negativity. 
129,bug,PapaKong,Sep 23 @ 2:20pm ,This forum is meant to talk about the game and bugs are part of the game so complaining about issues is legitimate. You have the right to express your opinion but without interfering with the freedom to speak about the problems since the resumption of the game by paradox. If Paradox could provide the last version made by introversion it would already be better than nothing since they only make the situation worse.

133,bug,Sep 24 @ 8:08pm,Any suggestions?,"I might be having the same issues as other people with this game.  Within the last 24 hours, I played the game three time.  All was fine last week, minus the kitchen and canteen not linking up to feed inmates. I went online and found suggestions, as I went on to play this evening, I disabled any mods I might have had in game to run basic vanilla with no mods, however, there are major ""bugs"" during game play. The most annoying is the glitch that changes the icons of everything in build mode, for example, the jail door looks like a screwdriver, etc., and the second, is the huge heads in place of normal bodies of people.  I have yet to find why my canteen is not linked to feed people, it is connected to kitchen, and there are no breaks in the fence for escaping peeps. I even tried using the logistics that shows a yellow arrow of link and path from kitchen to canteen and kitchen to holding cell.  This problem although is not allowing me to open the prison since i cannot feed the inmates, the new glitches are at the forefront.  To either issue, any suggestions?"

If you have experienced a bug not already in this list, please let us know in this thread.Remember to include if you are using mods (and if you do, try to disable them - as sometimes they cause issues) and how to reproduce the bug you are experiencing. Being able to recreate a bug is the first step in understanding what is wrong and how it could be fixed! :)Reported Issues:Tyre apparatus can no longer be rotated.Player (Warden) can not use ferries in Warden Mode. Staff and inmates no longer do the eating animation.Fire engine spawns if dismissing fire brigade after dismissing helicopter.The Chinese edition still has half of English words.The Rock will not catch fire or take damage no matter what material or object it is.Stepping stones/pallets interferes with the pathing when trying to create a ferry line after removed. Released prisoners remain at the prison on Island plot (no road access)Armed guards do not display their weapon correctly with free-fire OFF.Guards and armed guards pavilion deployments getting erased upon reloading a save.The Elite Ops is not contributing to Danger level or mentioned in Danger tab.The Visitor helicopter still arrives to take visitors from prison after disabling that option in logistics.Snipers no longer cycle breaks correctly and get stuck.Janitors do not clean prisons reliably.Unable to remove tunnels underneath the main road.Game crashes trying to employ Modded rooms.The labour allocation of the prisoners in the forest enterprise disappearing after reloading a saved game.The french edition still has half of English words.Kitchens are now severely under-producing enough meals.Cell-assignment of prisoners no longer working.Unable to build bridges next to other objects. Prisoners passing parole no longer give release bonus and are not counted as released prisoners. Staff showers and toilets crash the game.During the work hours, the employed prisoners will remain just standstill in the laundry and cleaning cupboard.Zone a modded room can cause the game to crash. Checkpoints are cancelling tasks when prisoners are walking close. The National Guard won\\\'t dock if helipad is missing.When an informant is on route to the security room and finally arrives, they reset and teleports back to their cell.

I\\\'m not saying ""I want to have a wall underneath my bridge but I can\\\'t"". I know I can\\\'t, I know I can use your mod to circumvent that. No issues there. The issue is that there\\\'s some things that are either bugs, or the devs don\\\'t tell you, which make the bridges very fiddly.

In fact thanks to Introversion the game was never in a fine state and probably never will be because Paradox would have to completely rewrite the game from scratch to iron out Introversion\\\'s sloppy work which they obviously won\\\'t do due to the effort required... so they just seem to live with it.There were a million bugs back in the day and Introversion still had the nerve to call it 1.0 and officially out of alpha even though there existed bugs all the way from the beginning of the first few alpha releases and which they totally knew about because I was among the people who reported several issues a dozen times over. (some of which fixed only ever since Paradox took over)They just had little to no quality control going and kept on accumulating bugs for years because new features were a better short term selling point than 6 months of bug fixing.Hell, even Sony/Microsoft told Introversion that they should get someone else, a third party company (Double Eleven) to fix the game for a console release because of the Quality assurance departments of both companies already knowing that Introversion wouldn\\\'t be able to do it properly and neither Sony/Microsoft wanted the blame of a bad release on their heads. That\\\'s what Introversion guys even said themselves on one of their YT streams. Granted Console ports take some expierience to do yet if you ask me that MS/Sony had no confidence in Introversion was a huge warning sign already right there. And funnily from what I heard the console version was actually better in performance and a lot less buggy than the PC version at the time due to the efforts of Double Eleven.To be honest I had the confidence that Introversion would get their stuff together eventually but what finally broke it for me was when in 2018 the guys behind Introversion had the arrogance and insolence to act like there were no problems and like it was the best game ever on their YT channel in response to some legitimate criticism about the questionable state of the PC version was in shortly before announcing the sellout, leaving the mess for someone else to fix, which to this day I still find the most irresponsible course of action they possibly could have taken because it makes them look like a bunch of total slackers only interested in making a quick buck.And I don\\\'t envy Paradox being that fall guy who has to clean up after the mess... yet I don\\\'t really feel pity for them either because I admit that they also have a specific reputation of their own... mostly for their DLC policies in their other IPs and them often also being released in a total buggy state where early buyers/hardcore fans kinda end up being misused as beta testers."

I hope you find more joy in the game now If we\\\'re talking about realism, I would also like to get more than 4 hours of sleep daily, and not sleep if I have no need for it, but since the latest updates prisoners sleep even if they have 0 need for it, and their sleep needs (if they exist) can be satisfied with under 4 hours of sleep. Also, some prisoners will change clothes but at any given time, more than 50% of them will have a high clothing need. This is completely different from the way it was in the past, it is literally impossible to satisfy clothing needs completely now. You can try this for yourself: even if you hire more janitors than prisoners and give them free time all day, the clothing need will still be high. Is this what realism is?Janitors clean better after the latest hotfixes, but it is still a downgrade from the situation pre-upgrade. Also, I notice you didn\\\'t address the issue about being unable to build bridges next to each other, or for that matter having to leave a gap around a bridge in all directions. Also, my complaint about bridges is being unable to start or end them at the tile directly next to the road, please let me know if this is another ""feature"" that is not clear to me.

265,bug,Wolfschadow,Jul 7 @ 3:29pm,a bug on the menu
266,bug,Jul 12 @ 7:36pm,8 bugs I encountered in my current playthrough.,"I\\\'ve started a new prison and ran into several issues during my playthrough.  My guess is I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m about 40+ hours into this one. I\\\'ll try to provide as much detail as possible but on the off chance the dev\\xe2\\x80\\x99s look at this I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be happy to provide whatever info is needed.ver. The Rock 1.02 R3593\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDog\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (barking cats in my case)  no longer seem to sniff out tunnels. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had blocks surrendered by patrols on all 4 sides and they definitely walked over tunnels on many occasions though did not sense them. Given how rare it is for guards to find them while searching toilets, this makes escapes way too common.Some escapee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s seem to insist on running back in during an escape attempt. My last escapee actually tunneled to the center top of my map, on the day of his release, ran all the way to my prison\\\'s entrance at the middle of the road before getting tazed. I think he was trying to get back to his cell? I had two others get to the map edge and attempt to break back in.The \\xe2\\x80\\x9cclothing needs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d bug. I\\\'ve seen it around on forums. From what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen in my playthrough it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not that the prisoners are not receiving clothes. However, it seems like the need goes from nothing to maxed out by lunch.Physiatrist not being used. In the entirety of my playthrough (30-50 CI prisoners in block) only 4 sessions occurred. It did not seem to be an access to room, or scheduling issue, the queue just never went up. Warp to bed issue. If a prisoner is in bed and overdoses, or gets called up to snitch. The guard will take them to where they need to go, when they arrive they are set back to bed. If they are Overdosing they die. This got many of my prisoners killed. This also occasionally came with a graphic issue where the guard would transport an invisible prisoner. Tunnel under road issue. This was apparently marked as fixed in an earlier update. However, tunnels going under the road could not be removed for me.Forestry Labour issues. This initially worked fine, though after expanding the forestry room it was no longer able to assign prisoners to it. There is access to both delivery and export rooms so I\\\'m not sure why that happened.Any program change, even unrelated ones will cancel any running event. (not really a bug, just super annoying)I receive a lot of extra books with short bookcases in my common rooms, but they do not get stocked. My library is just a mess of boxes.Improvement suggestions:Ability to decide what rooms programs will occur in. At the moment we need to add and remove scheduled programs until we get lucky. Case example: I made a common room specially for AA meetings. Literally a room with chairs. I want that room used for the program but since other common rooms had chairs it was difficult to set it up. I also want parole rooms in my protective block to run at night (when the protectives are awake) but that is annoying to set up.If I have a staff door, it means I only want staff to use it. The current behavior is that visitors and prisoners will treat staff doors as jail doors, waiting for guards to open them. No one will pathfinder around them. At least we should be able to set should and should not use doors.When using the cell quality rating option, we need a way to see what quality of cell prisoners are willing to stay in, a \\xe2\\x80\\x9callow prisoners in cells that are too good for them\\xe2\\x80\\x9d option would be really helpful with transfers.The new scanner machine seems pretty useless. Though it scans some things, I have items entering and exiting my delivery room every .5 seconds at times, with massive truck back-ups, workers do not have time to load and unload it.Visitors should not be allowed in staff only areas. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99d need visitor access areas to mark areas where visitors and staff are allowed, but prisoners are not.Not being able to set staff canteens without deployment makes early game difficult.  We should be allowed to set staff only areas from the start. For the sake of a simulation I don\\\'t imagine having a staff only area requires research.  "

Also, the dormitories for Protective Custody have a clear route of access and still apparently don\\\'t have access to the canteen specifically made so they won\\\'t get shanked.3) Comfy beds apparently don\\\'t register as beds in cells.

I created a prison which had over 80% pop in dorms.  Each dorm (with a couple cells attached) was a separate building - like PoW camps.  The issue here was the way the game treats fog of war.

J\\\'ai lu et relu les discussions et j\\\'ai un petit listing sur les bugs que je vois depuis que j\\\'ai pris le dernier DLC du jeu (voir avant), donc ma liste s\\\'additionne \\xc3\\xa0 d\\\'autres : - Je ne m\\\'\\xc3\\xa9tonne plus de voir des prisonniers mourir parce qu\\\'ils cr\\xc3\\xa8vent la dalle, que l\\\'on mette un seul ou 40 cuistots, \\xc3\\xa0 peine 10% (des fois moins) des repas sont servis (merci l\\\'apprentissage de l\\\'optimisation des cuisines et des cantines pour voir ses prisonniers partir en live parce qu\\\'ils ont pas mang\\xc3\\xa9 peu importe la manip pour essayer de d\\xc3\\xa9buguer \\xc3\\xa7a)-Dans le parloir, quand plusieurs cabines sont align\\xc3\\xa9es et coll\\xc3\\xa9es d\\\'une part et d\\\'autre de murs (histoire que les prisonnier ne passent pas du c\\xc3\\xb4t\\xc3\\xa9 visiteur), a chaque fin de visite le jeu bug et les visiteurs passent du c\\xc3\\xb4t\\xc3\\xa9 prisonnier et inversement. Cependant tout fonctionne si, coll\\xc3\\xa9 a un mur je met une table de parloir, puis coll\\xc3\\xa9 a cette table une cabine, puis une autre table coll\\xc3\\xa9 a l\\\'autre mur, que de techniques pour surpass\\xc3\\xa9 le bug (au moins \\xc3\\xa7a m\\\'occupe pendant que d\\\'autres cr\\xc3\\xa8ve la faim). -Ca fait depuis le DLC psy que \\xc3\\xa7a le fait, mais si les personnes a l\\\'HP ne peuvent pas passer en conditionnelle, \\xc3\\xa7a sert a quoi de mette ""15 personnes en attente de conditionnelle"" si je peux en placer que 3 ou 4  r\\xc3\\xa9ellement ? C\\\'est minime mais \\xc3\\xa7a me parait tout con a r\\xc3\\xa9soudre pour le c\\xc3\\xb4t\\xc3\\xa9 gestion. Ou alors il faut mettre la salle de conditionnelle pour les ali\\xc3\\xa9n\\xc3\\xa9 uniquement ? Expliquez moi. En plus du c\\xc3\\xb4t\\xc3\\xa9 bug vis \\xc3\\xa0 vis des cuistots, j\\\'ai la sensation qu\\\'il faut bient\\xc3\\xb4t un gardien par prisonnier si on veut que la prison tourne (et un aide soignant par ali\\xc3\\xa9n\\xc3\\xa9), des fois ils partent en patrouille alors qu\\\'il n\\\'y a pas de patrouille a certains endroits, des fois ils ouvrent la porte \\xc3\\xa0 des prisonnier histoire qu\\\'ils s\\\'\\xc3\\xa9vadent du coup \\xc3\\xa7a me cr\\xc3\\xa9er une \\xc3\\xa9meute et tous le monde veut s\\\'enfuir (et z\\\'est partiii). En 3 ans de jeu, le seul bug que je ne vois plus c\\\'est le fait que le jeu crash a r\\xc3\\xa9p\\xc3\\xa9tition quand un gardien met un coup de taser pendant une bagarre. Est ce r\\xc3\\xa9ellement tous les joueurs paient pour des bugs a la con ? Et du coup si vous avez r\\xc3\\xa9ponse \\xc3\\xa0 cette question n\\\'h\\xc3\\xa9sitez pas : Constatez-vous des bugs si vous ne prenez pas les ali\\xc3\\xa9n\\xc3\\xa9s ?

(so far I am only building a foundation of brick, fences, and large jail doors, so this may change after I build my kitchen).2)  On full speed, all the people are moving working at actual full speed (this could simply be because I only have like 20 construction workers so far....will try and update as my prison grows)I am using some mods (snitch sorter, money laundering, vending machines, larger power machine....to name a few), and I\\\'m using ALL the DLC\\\'s (island bound, psych ward, cleared for transfer).I just started a game to see if bug was all the time, so far not seeing any.This might, and probably will, change as I build up more (kitchen, janitors, etc...), and when I play more in the next few days I will try and update this to either show it is still working....or that the bugs started up again.If anyone starts a brand new game (with all the DLC\\\'s) and finds out if bugs disappear, or bugs start up again, please post here.

I don\\\'t know if it has happened to more people, but I think It was curious and I wanted to share it with the community.So a few days ago, I started a new prison with the \\\'events\\\' option enabled and as the tittle suggests all of my prisoners had guard keys. That means they could open every door in prison plus they were always on punishement for contraband (My metal detectors were constantly detecting it). Also they had access to all type of weapons without been in the specific room to take them. They had knifes, drills, shotguns... At some point I wasn\\\'t sure if maybe I was imprisoning a guerrilla(Note: They all were minimun security prisoners). My prison was a war zone with shots everywhere and with 70+ prisoners waiting for punish in the solitary room (I had 6 solitary rooms prepared). In conclusion, prison ruined and 5 hours wasted.It\\\'s incredible how a patch can ruin a game that in the past was fun to play. Introversion should have never ever sold prison architect to Paradox.

Everytime they patch it there is a completely new bug I have never seen before and not just one but a proliferation of the things. Take the planning tool, the damned thing is bullet proof, its never once malfunctioned in 4 years. Overnight it becomes useless. Seriously paradox just frack off to your holiday and keep your $hit stained fingers off it."
483,bug,The Mighty Georg,Jul 27 @ 7:09am ,"I\\\'m having the same problem except early game I built all the usual buildings, 8 individual cells, accepted 2 low risk, 1 went in with a guard as usual the other is sitting in deliveries starving to death, i upped my guards from 3 to 8 but nadda. Every time I try to get into this game there always seems to be some unsolvable bug and then I realise why i stopped playing the last time."
484,bug,Jul 25 @ 8:23pm,"Road delivery is broken since ""The Rock"" and I\\\'m angry","I have 3 (+1) sophisticated prisons, each of which I spent ~100h on.Before the update, road deliveries worked just fine and the road gates at the top of the map were never blocked by stuck trucks. I took great care to balance deliveries, workers etc. to ensure that.Now, what happens EVERY SINGLE TIME is that trucks pile up all the way to the top of the map. If you don\\\'t know why that is REALLY REALLY BAD, here\\\'s a brief summary:- Deliveries are delayed, potentially causing shortages of meals, workshop materials etc.- Playing in escape mode becomes a chore, because your prisoner truck is stuck the f***ing queue for hours- All road gates are open ALL THE TIME, so escaping gets more easy than it should be- Now that building materials are road delivered too, it becomes a pain to build virtually anything.Apparently, the developers forgot that there are existing prisons that get broken by messing with deliveries. Or, if you are very cynical, they broke road deliveries on purpose, so that you have to buy Island Bound and set up helicopters to do what worked just fine before the patch. GRRRBy the way, THERE IS NO WORKAROUND except for Mods. The size of a prison and the size of the map impose a bottleneck that you cannot get around. With the current state of the game LARGE PRISONS WITH WORKSHOPS HAVE BECOME UNSUSTAINABLE.I\\\'m not sure what exactly causes this sh**load of additional trucks, it looks like there\\\'s WAY MORE food deliveries than there used to be, but I\\\'m tired of investigating game-breaking bugs brought in by the new devs. I\\\'ve done that before, when custom sectors made my save-game unplayable back when Cleared for Transfer was released. Enough is enough!"

I watched one of my cooks crack an egg, then promptly bring it directly to the canteen. 5 other cooks were all doing the same thing.Anyway, they\\\'ll stop cooking for the meal period well before its time to eat, then spring into action after the first tray gets picked up.

511,feature,Medu Salem,Jun 24 @ 12:30pm ,"Originally posted by RatBag:Because the game was fine as it was back in 2014 onwards No it wasn\\\'t fine. In fact thanks to Introversion the game was never in a fine state and probably never will be because Paradox would have to completely rewrite the game from scratch to iron out Introversion\\\'s sloppy work which they obviously won\\\'t do due to the effort required... so they just seem to live with it.There were a million bugs back in the day and Introversion still had the nerve to call it 1.0 and officially out of alpha even though there existed bugs all the way from the beginning of the first few alpha releases and which they totally knew about because I was among the people who reported several issues a dozen times over. (some of which fixed only ever since Paradox took over)They just had little to no quality control going and kept on accumulating bugs for years because new features were a better short term selling point than 6 months of bug fixing.Hell, even Sony/Microsoft told Introversion that they should get someone else, a third party company (Double Eleven) to fix the game for a console release because of the Quality assurance departments of both companies already knowing that Introversion wouldn\\\'t be able to do it properly and neither Sony/Microsoft wanted the blame of a bad release on their heads. That\\\'s what Introversion guys even said themselves on one of their YT streams. Granted Console ports take some expierience to do yet if you ask me that MS/Sony had no confidence in Introversion was a huge warning sign already right there. And funnily from what I heard the console version was actually better in performance and a lot less buggy than the PC version at the time due to the efforts of Double Eleven.To be honest I had the confidence that Introversion would get their stuff together eventually but what finally broke it for me was when in 2018 the guys behind Introversion had the arrogance and insolence to act like there were no problems and like it was the best game ever on their YT channel in response to some legitimate criticism about the questionable state of the PC version was in shortly before announcing the sellout, leaving the mess for someone else to fix, which to this day I still find the most irresponsible course of action they possibly could have taken because it makes them look like a bunch of total slackers only interested in making a quick buck.And I don\\\'t envy Paradox being that fall guy who has to clean up after the mess... yet I don\\\'t really feel pity for them either because I admit that they also have a specific reputation of their own... mostly for their DLC policies in their other IPs and them often also being released in a total buggy state where early buyers/hardcore fans kinda end up being misused as beta testers."

I hope you find more joy in the game now If we\\\'re talking about realism, I would also like to get more than 4 hours of sleep daily, and not sleep if I have no need for it, but since the latest updates prisoners sleep even if they have 0 need for it, and their sleep needs (if they exist) can be satisfied with under 4 hours of sleep. Also, some prisoners will change clothes but at any given time, more than 50% of them will have a high clothing need. This is completely different from the way it was in the past, it is literally impossible to satisfy clothing needs completely now. You can try this for yourself: even if you hire more janitors than prisoners and give them free time all day, the clothing need will still be high. Is this what realism is?Janitors clean better after the latest hotfixes, but it is still a downgrade from the situation pre-upgrade. Also, I notice you didn\\\'t address the issue about being unable to build bridges next to each other, or for that matter having to leave a gap around a bridge in all directions. Also, my complaint about bridges is being unable to start or end them at the tile directly next to the road, please let me know if this is another ""feature"" that is not clear to me. As for having to give a bridge a 2 block run to build it over a wall, I don\\\'t even have a wall, I\\\'m just trying to get it over a jail door and across the road.

It\\\'s not their fault that you are being ignorant and impatient. I think it\\\'s a good time now to take a month of bug fixing.

546,feature,ight.phonix,"May 30, 2014 @ 4:59am ","I think this is a great idea and it will make the game run smoothly. For those who say that it will take a long time to resolve those bugs (3 1/2 years ) I think you are wrong. As I see it there are a lot of bugs duplicates or bugs that if they are fixed resolve multiple problems. Also I see there are lots of ""bugs"" that don\\\'t make any sense. For example ""Remove electrical chair from the game"" and this I think is a feature removal and not a bug. Also for those that say this is a big mess I think this was improved a lot over every alpha. I have played released games that are more buggy and prone to crashes."
547,feature,Click here to jump to that post.,Originally posted by The Queen Salis:,"yes, there is actually that feature in the game. It might be only available after you enable transfers.You can also just use ""Search Cell Clock"" in the blocks you want, but segmented bangup, lockdown, freefire and shakedown have been implemented in one of the free dlcs"
548,feature,Aug 5 @ 3:05am,"Paradox: Fix the game, stop ruining it!","See title. The game is a mess now. It was always a little buggy, even in the Introversion days, but you could usually fix everything by saving and reloading the game. And actual gamebreaking bugs were very rare. Now they\\\'re abundant. From building not working, utilities not working, food and laundry distribution not working, trucks coming in with one box of staff meals, 8 trucks after one another instead of one full truck, to all the other little stuff you read about here.Don\\\'t get me wrong: some of the new features, even free features for the vanilla game, are great. In principle. I had been wishing for shared sectors since the Alpha days. Now they\\\'re here, great. But apparently they just don\\\'t work as intended. So you have two options here, Paradox, unless you want the Steam reviews to drift to ""mostly positive"", then ""mostly negative"", etc. 1. Fix the game. And fix it, BEFORE you put out new content. 2. Give us the option to revert the game to previous versions. I\\\'d like to play the game I bought from Introversion again, you know. The mostly bug free, consistent, working and fun game, that was also the best management game ever created. Before you got your hands on it. (3. Please do both!)Dear fellow (former) fans of the game: please leave a negative Steam review if you also get gamebreaking bugs, several different types per session, like I do."
549,feature,xc3\\x98racle,Aug 12 @ 1:02pm ,"I just started playing again, after 5 years. I don\\\'t use any mods, and the only DLC I have is the free one. I encountered bugs I couldn\\\'t remember from before, within about 1 minute of my first intake. I had an inmate arrive with contraband. It was confiscated, and because they were a part of the very first group of prisoners (6 in total), I ended their punishment of lock-down. However, this left them in lock-down permanently until I had them searched, which.. somehow reset their status. Next, I tried using the planner\\\'s build feature with auto-foundations to make my swanky new office building for upcoming head-hanchos. No matter what I did, foundations would never be made. Everything turned into walls with no roof or floor. I don\\\'t know which team added that feature, but it doesn\\\'t work at all."

553,feature,Jet City Gambler,Aug 5 @ 2:17pm ,"It really doesn\\\'t seem to make much of a difference -- shuffling prisoners between cells is pretty low on the guards\\\' priority list, so you\\\'ll inevitably end up with a 0 quality guy living in a luxury cell. When they introduced the feature, the way it was supposed to work is that prisoners in high-quality cells are happier and thus less likely to commit offenses.I\\\'ve never noticed that to actually be the case. What usually happens is people get caught with contraband or something and then get assigned to a 0 quality cell after solitary, then the guards shuffle a few guys around, and that\\\'s about it. If you have a lot of empty cells (like a prison at 50% capacity or so) they get transferred more often, but then they get popped for drugs and back to square 0.I\\\'ve found it works fine if you follow your current plan with a few 7-8 level cells, some more 3-5 level cells, and a bunch of 0-1 hellholes."
554,feature,twd2007,Aug 4 @ 9:11am ,"Originally posted by DeadlyIceberg:Here is my idea: allow us to build multiple level prisons just like real prisons. In order to have a lot of prisoners, we need to build huge prisons to house them. If we could build up instead of out, it will allow for a different play style and cause the prisoners to use different escape methods sort of like the television show Prison Break. I think they should use a similar multiple floors thing as SimAirport, but release it as a seperate DLC for those who don\\\'t want it. I think it would be a total game changer, but would kind of take away the simplicity of the game. It\\\'s still a feature that i really want, even if it isn\\\'t realistic. Just take a look at SimAirport, they seem to have managed it well"
