3,bug,Gnomoria v1.0 released!,"Feb 23, 2016","This release marks Gnomoria\\\'s transition out of Early Access!  This update adds a ton of quality of life changes, additional support for mod developers, a debug mode for testing and spawning items and gnomes, optimizations and tons of bug fixes.Check out the full patch notes here[forums.gnomoria.com]."
4,bug,Gnomoria v0.9.15,"Oct 7, 2014","General Stockpile UI is now resizable.  Size and position are preserved across play sessions like other resizable windows Added a restock threshold setting to each stockpile  Stockpile automatically suspends itself when full and unsuspends when there are the same or more number of spaces available as the threshold Manually turning suspend on or off will override any automated behavior\ Gnomes now use items that can be piled (dirt, stone, straw, etc) to pick up similar items while stocking Added an option on the Smelter to automatically smelt worn itemsFixed Visual artifacts with some spritesThis update has been crazy!  If you haven\\\'t seen the indev board on the official forums, I ran into a ton of bugs getting dirt, etc to act like wheelbarrows.  Some bugs might have been old but the majority were new, so I left them out of the changelist going from 0.9.14 to 0.9.15.  This has been the longest patch in Gnomoria\\\'s history and took much longer than I or anyone could have guessed.  I\\\'ll still be working on bugs along the way but it will be nice to start working on some other areas of the game again :) Also, I wanna say thanks to everyone who\\\'s been testing out the changes on the indev branch.  It\\\'s been a huge help, you guys are awesome!"

7,feature,Piyo,"Jan 14, 2014 @ 12:58pm ","I know it\\\'s a bitof an odd thing, but I quite enjoyed dealing with flooding. I\\\'m wondering if that might come back in as an additional feature, at the moment water seems to evaporate more than refilling... Still realy looking forward to seeing what the diplomacy is like!"
