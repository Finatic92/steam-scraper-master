9,crash,"Dec 14, 2018 @ 5:01am",Updated Roadmap,"Kenshi has now left Early Access and is fully released.What does this mean for Kenshi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s future? It means that there will be no new features added, Kenshi is feature complete, but we will be continuing to fix all crashes and bugs reported to us. Localisations (in German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian and Japanese) have all been finished and are in game, however we have been noticing a couple of small issues popping up since release, so we will continue to refine these.BUGS & CRASHESRight now we are working hard on bug fixes \\xe2\\x80\\x93 We understand crashes and bugs can be frustrating, you can report all instances in our Steam or Lo-Fi forums and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll look into it asap.LOCALISATIONWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had a few issues reported including some missing strings which didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t export and text not fitting in GUI buttons. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re on it and should have an update out within the week. We also had reports from Japanese players that the translation is inaccurate and\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 not so good. So we have employed an experienced video game proofreader to refine this. You should see gradual improvement patches for Japanese over the next few months, we aim to be finished with all edits by March 2019. We welcome any feedback from all non-English speaking players!LUXURY FEATURESWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen some confusion amongst the community about luxury features and optimisation upgrades coming. Just to clarify, we will not be adding any more features or engine changes to Kenshi. Fortunately we were able to add a few luxury features before release including crawling combat, unarmed combat, dismemberment, blood and ranged combat. However no more luxury features will be being added."
10,crash,July Community Update,Aug 4,"Hi all. As with previous posts, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll start by recapping a few things going on with the continued support for the first Kenshi. For this blog\\xe2\\x80\\x99s special section, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re catching up with some of the team at Lo-fi to find out what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s keeping them sane in isolation before finally getting to development news on Kenshi 2.Experiment recursion.In the past month we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve once again been making use of the experimental branch, most notably around an issue users reported with saved games following the latest windows update. Many players had stated they were unable to save, load, or experienced crashing when they tried. In Kenshi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s latest v1.0.50 update saves default to the Windows user directory, fixing any potential issues linked to system permissions. Please keep in mind that if you wish to edit a saved game the new location to check is C:\\\\Users\\\\<YourUsername>\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\kenshi\\\\save. Defined interpretation.Hinted above, after consulting with the forum mods we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve made some overdue changes to bug reporting flow \\xe2\\x80\\x93 namely better collating more widely popular bugs, cleaning up a number of older topics, and providing a more visible response to new ones. This will likely mean pushing for a stricter adherence to the bug reporting format as I work to ensure they can be reproduced and turn them into meaningful notes to the programming team to progress. The end goal here is to keep fixing issues for in Kenshi 1 in a more transparent way, giving users more feedback on if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s feasibly possible to fix and where we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re at with their reports. For a more worded explanation of the changes check out the pinned topic here.Hey, Fans!In past blog posts we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve mentioned hiring a number of new team members to expand the studio for Kenshi 2. Over the next few updates, since we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re focussed on an important Kenshi 2 subproject (details further down) I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m taking the opportunity to catch up with different team members and share a little bit of who they are, what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re up to outside of the studio, and how they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing working from home.Guy \\xe2\\x80\\x98Warls\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Warley \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Concept ArtistI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m Guy, a concept designer with a background in graphic design, illustration and advertising. I joined the team in November 2019 and have been working on concepts for the architecture, furniture, and characters that inhabit the world of Kenshi 2.Home setup:For my home setup I recently purchased a Wacom Cintiq Pro 24[www.wacom.com], replacing my Wacom Intous 3. After spending 12 years with the Intuos 3 (which is still going strong) it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a big upgrade. I initially thought it was going to take a lot of time to get used to the switch but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m already really enjoying it and using it every day. The Cintiq is connected to my MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015) which works pretty well running things like Photoshop.Thoughts on working on Kenshi from home:I am quite used to working at home and have got into a good routine over the years. I do miss working in the office though, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s much easier to talk through different areas of the project with everyone in the same room, much less typing!Life balance:I have been spending the lockdown back in my hometown near East Yorkshire by the coast. Running and walking are the main things keeping me going. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m also doing some yoga in the mornings, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m rubbish at it but enjoying it anyway.In my free time I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been working on several of my own illustrations, such as the album covers for three different electronic artists that I finished recently.Other freelance projects I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve worked on that people might recognise include art for mud-and-lasers RPG \\xe2\\x80\\x98Lancer\\xe2\\x80\\x99[www.guywarley.com] and a cover for the gritty future comic \\xe2\\x80\\x98The Hand Unseen\\xe2\\x80\\x99[www.guywarley.com]. Right now, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m working on some posters based on my favourite Studio Ghibli films which follow on from other personal projects like last year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Akira poster[www.guywarley.com]. Victor \\xe2\\x80\\x98Mr4Goosey\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Goossens \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Technical ArtistI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m Victor, or Mr4Goosey. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been doing indie-dev on my own projects for over half a decade, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve spent part of that doing it for a living. I got fed up of running my own business and decided to look for a full-time job in the industry, leading me to Lo-Fi. I wanted to combine my love for making pretty things with interests in logic and programming, which is why I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m now a technical artist.Home setup:I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m running a custom PC with a Ryzen 7 2700X and a GTX1080. For peripherals, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got a Decus mouse and a Razer Blackwidow (Green switches) both with lovely wrist-rests. Finally, for screens I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m running a 34\\xe2\\x80\\x9d LG Ultra-wide which I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m looking to replace with something less bulky and a 27\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AOC monitor on the side.Thoughts on working on Kenshi from home:Thanks to past projects I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m used to working from home, so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really not that special to me, ironically being in an office will take more getting used to. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nice to be in my own place and have access to my stuff, but when everything happens in the same room it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easy to lose sight of the boundaries between work and life. It can also be hard to get to know the team properly when we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve not properly met. All in all, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m looking forward to being in-office; working from home feels less efficient and enjoyable than being together with people, plus it gets lonely and boring.Life balance:I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve started another gamedev project in my spare time, though I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been trying to get away from my computer too. Out of my new interests the main one that helps is blacksmithing. Unfortunately, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a forge yet \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll probably have to wait until I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve moved to the UK, but as I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m mostly focussed on armouring, I can do quite a lot anyway. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a steep learning curve, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really cool to produce something like a piece of armour out of nothing.I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m also just getting into electronics and robotics. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been putting off for as long as I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been doing gamedev, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m hoping to get started on it properly now. First steps are reading up on basic electronics (I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be able to give you a definition of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cservo\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), because that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the main part I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m lacking. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m hoping I can get the hang of that then get properly stuck in!Lastly, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been doing more gamedev. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve recently started playing around with Phyronnaz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Voxel Plugin for UE4[github.com], and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m currently trying to make a small, relaxing game in which you build a low-poly eco dome with cute animals in it. Not sure exactly where it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be going, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m hoping to release it on Steam for a few bucks at some point in a similar vein to Islanders.Harrison \\xe2\\x80\\x98Boodals\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 ProgrammerI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m Harrison, or Boodals, the programmer who was hired back in November. Up until now I\\\'ve been working on remaking the GUIs from Kenshi 1 in Unreal Engine, but now that we\\\'ve hired Craig, I can shift my efforts onto less urgent tasks, such as code cleanliness and stability. I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go into too much detail, but I\\\'d call it more of a support role, making the other programming jobs easier and faster, and discouraging code which could be unstable.Home setup:Since we started working from home, I\\\'ve been using my own PC for most tasks. We do all have laptops to work on, but I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have the desk space to fit mine. Using my PC also allows me to test the GUIs I previously spoke about on a 4k screen to make sure everything functions correctly at higher resolutions.Thoughts on working on Kenshi from home:Working from home is pretty great, mainly due to lie-ins and easy access to snacks (ha-ha), but it does come with its downsides. Not being able to quickly speak to other developers or show each other what we\\\'re working on makes it harder to get stuff done. We\\\'re exploring several apps and programs to minimize this, but you can\\\'t beat being in the same room.Life balance:Outside of work, the lockdown really hasn\\\'t affected me too much, as I\\\'m one of the lucky ones who isn\\\'t bothered by being locked in. I moved house just before the lockdown started, so I\\\'ve been hanging out with my new housemates and their cat, whom I pay tribute to in the form of pets every time I pass through Her domain (stairs, hallway, kitchen\\xe2\\x80\\xa6)Declarative prologue. The team have been hugely busy this month working on a \\xe2\\x80\\x98vertical slice\\xe2\\x80\\x99 of Kenshi 2, which I have the pleasure of sharing snippets of today. For those unaware of the terminology, a vertical slice is a portion of near-finished quality game which then allows a studio to visualise some of what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re up to. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s traditionally distinct from a prototype in that the quality is much higher leaving less room for flexibility but for us we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re blurring that line a bit and using it primarily as a tangible design tool. Internally nicknamed \\xe2\\x80\\x98Concrete Neon\\xe2\\x80\\x99, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about having a space to test and iterate on some of Kenshi 2\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ideas by taking them away from a design document and experiencing how they might actually be played. Sharing some thoughts on our first major milestone, Chris compares Concrete Neon to founding Kenshi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Holy Nation and his hands on approach to game design: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnyone who played the [Kenshi 1 early access] map in it\\\'s earliest incarnation will remember that only a small area around the holy nation was active, the rest was greyed-out and you couldn\\\'t go there, because it wasn\\\'t finished.  This gives us a test bed to get everything working early on so we can play the game and experiment.  I\\\'m not a very formal designer, my technique is iterative because my \\xe2\\x80\\x98special skill\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is playing a game for a while and then going ""hunger needs to be 0.8x slower and strength needs to raise 1.12x faster instead of 1.08x"".  It\\\'s also better that way because I can approach the design as a player rather than as a game designer.  I don\\\'t like game designers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d---This month\\xe2\\x80\\x99s blog post was intended for last so ran a little late, but we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d love to hear your thoughts in the comments \\xe2\\x80\\x93 with so many players following different game development projects it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great place to reflect. As ever you can join us on Twitter and Facebook[www.facebook.com] where we still have an upcoming creator competition to announce once we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve worked out the prizes... If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like a none-Steam way to keep up with the studio, blogs are available on our website[lofigames.com] and via our mailing list[eepurl.com].Cheers,"

13,crash,May Community Update,Jun 15,"Hi all, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s past time for another instalment of Kenshi development updates. As our second entry while working from home and with several new members of staff joining the team there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been a significant amount of \\xe2\\x80\\x98onboarding\\xe2\\x80\\x99 this month. To start I wanted to go over two ongoing major localisation projects and a recent virtual event for Kenshi. Lastly, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re sharing updates on Kenshi 2, taking this month to talk a bit more about the narrative and technical sides of building a large sandbox.   Localising KenshiIn the past we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve spoken about our passion for providing Kenshi in other languages, but we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve rarely delved into exactly what that entails. As two major languages are still due to be re-released, along with this month\\xe2\\x80\\x99s progress update it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good chance for us to touch on the concept of translation vs localisation. As any animation or foreign cinema fan would attest to, finding the nearest equivalent word to throw on a subtitle track is a very hit and miss experience. Often when a language is spoken, we use sayings and euphemisms to communicate a certain meaning that resonates with one culture but, even if translated, might be completely meaningless in another. On the simpler side, for anyone in their mid-20\\xe2\\x80\\x99s that grew up with the English dub of Pok\\xc3\\xa9mon here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a \\xe2\\x80\\x98jellydonut\\xe2\\x80\\x99.Except that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actually onigiri[en.wikipedia.org] or rice balls. As the western audience would have been unlikely to eat rice balls a decision was made to dub them as donuts and call it a day. A much closer cultural equivalence would have been something along the lines of a sandwich, dumpling, or pasty. None of that covers the visual side of what fans see on Ash\\xe2\\x80\\x99s adventure so at best it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still a very crude way of trying to relate that Brock was nice enough to pack some lunch for their journey. If you understand that and are now thinking what they could have done instead then congratulations, you just took a crash course in localisation. In Kenshi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s upcoming Japanese localisation, a lot of corrections have been made to dialogue that baffled Japanese players. For example, currently some ironies are translated with opposite meanings which leads to confusion when players need to make dialogue choices. Similarly, Meg has been replacing nonsensical direct translations with their Japanese equivalent phrases, e.g. the current \\\'eat boots\\\' is now correctly translated as \\\'kick your ass\\\'. Work is also being done to change proverbs that made no sense in Japanese culture. Players won\\\'t see \\\'out of the frying pan\\\' in the middle of conversation (referring to \\\'out of frying pan into the fire\\\') and will instead find a Japanese equivalent saying for a worsening situation. All this amounts to a near complete rewrite of our current Japanese text and requires a degree of thoughtful research - it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a very time-consuming process.Meanwhile, for the Korean localisation, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve recently released a major update. As we mentioned before we revisited it with a different team, but we also decided to collaborate with fan Jeffrey Jeoung to assist with quality assurance. This helped us by breaking through the language barrier which prevented us from otherwise checking on the quality of translations. Kenshi x Indie Live ExpoA quiet side effect of the ongoing current pandemic is the effect it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s having on live events across game development, whilst not as pressing of a concern as many other topics it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easy to forget we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in the middle of the busy season for live expos. Lo-Fi is excited to share, following the positive outcome of our last physical event in Shanghai, we worked with PLAYISM again to take part in our first digital event \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Indie Live Expo 2020[indie.live-expo.games]. Hosted by the famous Ryu\\xe2\\x80\\x99sOffice[ryusoffice.co.jp] in Japan, live streams were broadcast in English, Japanese and Chinese with aims \\xe2\\x80\\x98to promote friendship, fellowship, and enthusiasm through the medium of video games.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 A cause we were more than happy to add weight to.The event covered a range of different indie titles and initiatives including personal messages from beloved industry figures ZUN[en.touhouwiki.net] (Touhou Project[en.wikipedia.org]), Toby Fox[en.wikipedia.org] (Undertale[undertale.com], Deltarune[www.deltarune.com]) SWERY[en.wikipedia.org] (The GoodLife / White Owls Inc.[www.whiteowls.co.jp]) and KazuyaNino[www.animenewsnetwork.com] (TYPE-MOON[en.wikipedia.org]). Finally as many of the Kenshi Discord community can attest to, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m also a huge Evangelion fan so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s incredibly exciting mention that in advance of \\xe2\\x80\\x98Thrice upon a time\\xe2\\x80\\x99[www.evangelion.co.jp]there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an ongoing Evangelion inspired game jam which was announced during the event.Where to watch: YouTube (EN)/ YouTube (JP) / Twitch (EN)[www.twitch.tv] / Bilibili (CN)[www.bilibili.com]For more information check out the Indie Live Expo website[indie.live-expo.games]. Just communication.Similar to the real world, Kenshi 2 is going to be pretty big. Previously when talking to Nat she confirmed that whilst we still don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a marketing friendly measured size to rally behind, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be bigger than Kenshi 1. This raises two important questions: how do we make it feel alive and how will it work from a technical standpoint? Below Nat touches on the first point and the magic of the \\xe2\\x80\\x98narrative bark\\xe2\\x80\\x99. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHello! For the last few months, I\\\'ve been working on the little pieces of information that subtly unfold the various histories and cultures of Kenshi\\\'s world. Writing for a sandbox game can be a little different to other RPGs where the developers normally have more control over what the player hears and sees (and even what the NPCs do!). So, for Kenshi, I need to reflect the necessary information differently while also making sure the world feels alive and immersive.A few months back, I talked about roughly structuring our first factions\\\' layouts on the world map, but now my job is to zone in on the individual cities and their own mini conflicts. I\\\'ve been planning out what I like to call the \\\'Carrots\\\' - the local goals or tempting secrets for the player to explore. I then list out all the possible ways I can convey that information, using in-game item descriptions and different dialogues, or visually with assets.  We\\\'re strictly against traditional quest systems in Kenshi, so it\\\'s important for me to tell the player what they can do indirectly through the environment instead, planting seeds in your minds and making you want to do things for yourselves.One of those \\\'dribbles\\\' of information involves writing dialogue Barks. Barks are the short bits of dialogue that NPCs blurt out either in reaction to something, or just completely ambient comments - the ambient comments are the ones that I\\\'ve been writing and they\\\'re perfect for breathing life into a world, reinforcing goals and lore, and simply interacting with the player to really make them feel part of the world. BUT... I have to write a lot of those suckas while actually keeping them interesting and nonintrusive. They can be a bit mind numbing to work on but they\\\'re one of my favourite methods to paint a picture of a town via gossiping and general musings from citizens.If you\\\'d like to read more about my process with writing barks, I\\\'ve written a much more in-depth article on gamasutra[www.gamasutra.com] or you can follow me on Twitter\\xe2\\x80\\x9dBeautiful World.As readers already know, Kenshi 2 is in development using Unreal Engine 4 which is a major jump from an aging implementation of OGRE. Following on from the narrative elements of the world, Victor, our technical artist, has kindly offered to answer some questions about the technical aspects.Starting with a major pain point then, moving across large areas in Kenshi 1 leads to lots of \\xe2\\x80\\x98loading\\xe2\\x80\\x99 pauses. How does Unreal handle huge maps and will that help with this?\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUE4 has a system called World Composition - it allows us to divide the world into cells which are then automatically loaded as the camera approaches them. It can do that asynchronously, meaning it doesn\\\'t lock up the game; it\\\'s loading the data as a background task. We can divide buildings and such over these cells in order to keep them unloaded and have them automatically come in when needed. World Composition is also built to work with Unreal Engine\\\'s Landscape system. Unfortunately, the stock Landscape system isn\\\'t explicitly designed for a world as massive as Kenshi 2. While we still intend to use world composition, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s additional exploration going into third party options for the landscape system to go even further. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important for us to get this right as currently Kenshi 2\\\'s world is expected to end up even bigger than Kenshi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ~1000km2.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pretty huge, I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think of that many other games with similar scale. I appreciate it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not your field, but will World Composition mean no more units running into the sky?\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIdeally, but this also relates to pathing. We haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t finalised exactly how pathing will be handled in Kenshi 2, but our current expectation is that we\\\'ll be working with Recast (UE4\\\'s stock navmesh which is well-tested and reliable). So tentatively, no more people walking off into the big blue yonder. UE4 and Recast allow us to generate the navmesh where we need it with a large amount of flexibility, and it should, theoretically, handle our world really well. Either way, I\\\'m confident we\\\'ll have a lot less weird pathing going on than we do in the original game.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve mentioned streaming bits of world in and unloading it on the fly but let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s talk about building larger spaces. In talks from Unreal Fest it seemed like developers can make presets for objects or types of buildings, set the area boundaries then let the engine create an entire city for them to edit. Do we have anything like that helping us with Kenshi 2?\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThings like city-spawners are something that we can use, but because of the oddities about Kenshi\\\'s world and a bunch of specifics, we also can\\\'t rely on a generalised system. If we do want to end up using things like generators, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be developing a tool internally. One other big problem with these sorts of things is that if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s relied on too much then the world ends up feeling \\xe2\\x80\\x98same-y\\xe2\\x80\\x99.On the other hand, while it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lot of work for an artist to go through and manually put all the buildings and pots and pans in the right spot, it means they really are in a spot that does them justice. We do use modular (re-useable) pieces where we can, but we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re being careful with not overdoing them, after all we want Kenshi 2\\xe2\\x80\\x99s world to feel unique and distinct.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dWhat about when adding details to natural biomes?\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNatural environments are a lot easier to automate with those kinds of tools \\xe2\\x80\\x93 at least for the menial stuff like grass placement. Of course, we could manually position every blade of grass, but that would be a nightmare. What we actually do is procedurally place grass in the right spots determined by our level designer. There are also other procedural tools we can easily integrate into our workflow for natural assets \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for example Unreal has native Speedtree integration. Speedtree is a tool that allows us to make foliage \\xe2\\x80\\x9cspecies\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and generate as many unique trees in that species as we want. It makes the foliage-creation a lot less tedious than needing to manually model them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dIf everything is going to be nicely dressed up, how do you deal with performance hits for all that extra detail? \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor starters, Kenshi 1 didn\\\'t use LODs (dynamic changes in level of detail) which meant operating with a massively constrained tri-budget for near-camera-detail. Kenshi 2 make heavy use of LODs, and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re massively helped in that area by UE4\\\'s semi-automatic LOD generation systems. Essentially, we can have extra detailed meshes up-close, and turn them into simpler low-detail meshes when they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re further away. This all happens without any extra work on the artist\\\'s end.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dSo that covers some basic software optimisations, what about from a hardware perspective - Kenshi runs an older version of OGRE that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s famously single threaded so what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the difference with Unreal and Kenshi 2?\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a huge shift here, really. When Kenshi development started, multi-threaded CPUs really weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t that common yet, nor were the cores nearly as fast as they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re becoming now. For context, at the time Intel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s i3/i5/i7 release scheme didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even exist. In development, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important to work on systems that help as many people as reasonably possible to be able to play - Back then that meant there was no reason to go beyond a single-thread. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an incredibly complicated thing to code so it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worth the development time.That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s different now, even the average user runs 4 CPU cores. Unreal Engine, by default, runs its render-thread on a separate core. Kenshi 2 runs almost all of its logic on extra threads, of which there are now more, and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re faster. The gains made by proper multi-threading are massive at this point. Another thing which makes a big difference is that so many rendering-bottlenecks of the past decade have gone from being handled on the CPU to being on the GPU, which is significantly faster for calculations that need to happen hundreds of thousands of times per frame. GPUs have gotten exponentially faster over the past decade, and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s power we can properly tap into.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dA lot of this works on paper but what can you do to know if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re getting it right as it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being made?\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis sort of thing is for a large part just developing some sort of instinct for what you should and shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do. If you show me the profiler statistics for a given scene, along with a wireframe, I can generally pretty quickly figure out where any slowdowns are coming from. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s difficult to explain why in each case, that goes incredibly deep, but you get a feel for the patterns of what works and what consequences certain choices have.During initial development, you work on rough ideas, generally without hugging tight performance limits for everything. Once something\\xe2\\x80\\x99s working, then it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time to start looking whether the current cost is reasonable, and where you can easily scrape some frame time off it. The big analytical guns come out when you run into major performance problems. Generally, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a certain benchmark you want to hit for acceptable performance at minimum specs. Once you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re unable to hit that benchmark, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time to stare at lots-and-lots of numbers \\xe2\\x80\\x93 indicators of how costly parts of a scene are \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and go through what you can deduce from them.  Starting with the worst offenders, you \\xe2\\x80\\x98scrape some stuff off\\xe2\\x80\\x99, ever more aggressively. Optimisation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s basically a circle, it repeats as you go. Scenes keep growing and therefore getting more expensive, so you work your ass off to make sure you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re still meeting the benchmark by tearing the existing stuff apart more. The scene grows again and the cycle repeats.Finally, Epic just announced Unreal 5[www.unrealengine.com], as it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supposedly seamless to migrate there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s talk of us moving along with it. Are there any features that you saw and immediately thought \\xe2\\x80\\x98that would be perfect for Kenshi\\xe2\\x80\\x99?\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs a technical artist, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m incredibly excited to see what Unreal Engine 5 will bring us. If it delivers everything Epic has been marketing so far such as the lighting and geometry changes, it could be a massive game-changer. That said, we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how the final implementation will turn out so we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t count on it yet. The promotional material stresses that porting should be easy, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m confident it will be, but based on current information swapping from UE4 to UE5 won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t automatically mean much. The major gains with the new tech aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t user-oriented, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re things that will make a massive difference for the art creation workflow and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re already in the middle of that. We also can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work according to the new idealised workflow either. Obviously, as it wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be worthwhile to sit here twiddling our thumbs until UE5 comes out and make everything then, the current plan is to just continue developing as before and see what we can do when it arrives.Speculating on a hypothetical Kenshi 3 though\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 I imagine our workflow would be fundamentally different using UE5 as compared to our current art-pipelines, and I imagine it\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be significantly more time-efficient. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all very speculative though, so don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get too excited.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--- This month\\xe2\\x80\\x99s blog was a lengthy undertaking so I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m looking forward to hearing thoughts and questions from the community in the comments. As ever you can join us on Twitter and Facebook[www.facebook.com] where we have a soon-to-be-confirmed creator competition in the works. If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like a none-Steam way to keep up with the studio, blogs are available on our website[lofigames.com] and via our mailing list[eepurl.com].Cheers,"

It means that there will be no new features added, Kenshi is feature complete, but we will be continuing to fix all crashes and bugs reported to us. Localisations (in German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian and Japanese) have all been finished and are in game, however we have been noticing a couple of small issues popping up since release, so we will continue to refine these.BUGS & CRASHESRight now we are working hard on bug fixes \\xe2\\x80\\x93 We understand crashes and bugs can be frustrating, you can report all instances in our Steam or Lo-Fi forums and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll look into it asap.LOCALISATIONWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had a few issues reported including some missing strings which didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t export and text not fitting in GUI buttons. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re on it and should have an update out within the week. We also had reports from Japanese players that the translation is inaccurate and\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 not so good. So we have employed an experienced video game proofreader to refine this. You should see gradual improvement patches for Japanese over the next few months, we aim to be finished with all edits by March 2019. We welcome any feedback from all non-English speaking players!LUXURY FEATURESWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen some confusion amongst the community about luxury features and optimisation upgrades coming. Just to clarify, we will not be adding any more features or engine changes to Kenshi. Fortunately we were able to add a few luxury features before release including crawling combat, unarmed combat, dismemberment, blood and ranged combat. However no more luxury features will be being added."

28,bug,July Community Update,Aug 4,"Hi all. As with previous posts, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll start by recapping a few things going on with the continued support for the first Kenshi. For this blog\\xe2\\x80\\x99s special section, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re catching up with some of the team at Lo-fi to find out what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s keeping them sane in isolation before finally getting to development news on Kenshi 2.Experiment recursion.In the past month we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve once again been making use of the experimental branch, most notably around an issue users reported with saved games following the latest windows update. Many players had stated they were unable to save, load, or experienced crashing when they tried. In Kenshi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s latest v1.0.50 update saves default to the Windows user directory, fixing any potential issues linked to system permissions. Please keep in mind that if you wish to edit a saved game the new location to check is C:\\\\Users\\\\<YourUsername>\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\kenshi\\\\save. Defined interpretation.Hinted above, after consulting with the forum mods we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve made some overdue changes to bug reporting flow \\xe2\\x80\\x93 namely better collating more widely popular bugs, cleaning up a number of older topics, and providing a more visible response to new ones. This will likely mean pushing for a stricter adherence to the bug reporting format as I work to ensure they can be reproduced and turn them into meaningful notes to the programming team to progress. The end goal here is to keep fixing issues for in Kenshi 1 in a more transparent way, giving users more feedback on if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s feasibly possible to fix and where we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re at with their reports. For a more worded explanation of the changes check out the pinned topic here.Hey, Fans!In past blog posts we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve mentioned hiring a number of new team members to expand the studio for Kenshi 2. Over the next few updates, since we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re focussed on an important Kenshi 2 subproject (details further down) I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m taking the opportunity to catch up with different team members and share a little bit of who they are, what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re up to outside of the studio, and how they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing working from home.Guy \\xe2\\x80\\x98Warls\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Warley \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Concept ArtistI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m Guy, a concept designer with a background in graphic design, illustration and advertising. I joined the team in November 2019 and have been working on concepts for the architecture, furniture, and characters that inhabit the world of Kenshi 2.Home setup:For my home setup I recently purchased a Wacom Cintiq Pro 24[www.wacom.com], replacing my Wacom Intous 3. After spending 12 years with the Intuos 3 (which is still going strong) it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a big upgrade. I initially thought it was going to take a lot of time to get used to the switch but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m already really enjoying it and using it every day. The Cintiq is connected to my MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015) which works pretty well running things like Photoshop.Thoughts on working on Kenshi from home:I am quite used to working at home and have got into a good routine over the years. I do miss working in the office though, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s much easier to talk through different areas of the project with everyone in the same room, much less typing!Life balance:I have been spending the lockdown back in my hometown near East Yorkshire by the coast. Running and walking are the main things keeping me going. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m also doing some yoga in the mornings, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m rubbish at it but enjoying it anyway.In my free time I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been working on several of my own illustrations, such as the album covers for three different electronic artists that I finished recently.Other freelance projects I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve worked on that people might recognise include art for mud-and-lasers RPG \\xe2\\x80\\x98Lancer\\xe2\\x80\\x99[www.guywarley.com] and a cover for the gritty future comic \\xe2\\x80\\x98The Hand Unseen\\xe2\\x80\\x99[www.guywarley.com]. Right now, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m working on some posters based on my favourite Studio Ghibli films which follow on from other personal projects like last year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Akira poster[www.guywarley.com]. Victor \\xe2\\x80\\x98Mr4Goosey\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Goossens \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Technical ArtistI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m Victor, or Mr4Goosey. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been doing indie-dev on my own projects for over half a decade, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve spent part of that doing it for a living. I got fed up of running my own business and decided to look for a full-time job in the industry, leading me to Lo-Fi. I wanted to combine my love for making pretty things with interests in logic and programming, which is why I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m now a technical artist.Home setup:I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m running a custom PC with a Ryzen 7 2700X and a GTX1080. For peripherals, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got a Decus mouse and a Razer Blackwidow (Green switches) both with lovely wrist-rests. Finally, for screens I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m running a 34\\xe2\\x80\\x9d LG Ultra-wide which I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m looking to replace with something less bulky and a 27\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AOC monitor on the side.Thoughts on working on Kenshi from home:Thanks to past projects I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m used to working from home, so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really not that special to me, ironically being in an office will take more getting used to. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nice to be in my own place and have access to my stuff, but when everything happens in the same room it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easy to lose sight of the boundaries between work and life. It can also be hard to get to know the team properly when we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve not properly met. All in all, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m looking forward to being in-office; working from home feels less efficient and enjoyable than being together with people, plus it gets lonely and boring.Life balance:I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve started another gamedev project in my spare time, though I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been trying to get away from my computer too. Out of my new interests the main one that helps is blacksmithing. Unfortunately, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a forge yet \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll probably have to wait until I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve moved to the UK, but as I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m mostly focussed on armouring, I can do quite a lot anyway. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a steep learning curve, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really cool to produce something like a piece of armour out of nothing.I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m also just getting into electronics and robotics. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been putting off for as long as I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been doing gamedev, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m hoping to get started on it properly now. First steps are reading up on basic electronics (I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be able to give you a definition of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cservo\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), because that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the main part I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m lacking. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m hoping I can get the hang of that then get properly stuck in!Lastly, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been doing more gamedev. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve recently started playing around with Phyronnaz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Voxel Plugin for UE4[github.com], and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m currently trying to make a small, relaxing game in which you build a low-poly eco dome with cute animals in it. Not sure exactly where it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be going, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m hoping to release it on Steam for a few bucks at some point in a similar vein to Islanders.Harrison \\xe2\\x80\\x98Boodals\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 ProgrammerI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m Harrison, or Boodals, the programmer who was hired back in November. Up until now I\\\'ve been working on remaking the GUIs from Kenshi 1 in Unreal Engine, but now that we\\\'ve hired Craig, I can shift my efforts onto less urgent tasks, such as code cleanliness and stability. I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go into too much detail, but I\\\'d call it more of a support role, making the other programming jobs easier and faster, and discouraging code which could be unstable.Home setup:Since we started working from home, I\\\'ve been using my own PC for most tasks. We do all have laptops to work on, but I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have the desk space to fit mine. Using my PC also allows me to test the GUIs I previously spoke about on a 4k screen to make sure everything functions correctly at higher resolutions.Thoughts on working on Kenshi from home:Working from home is pretty great, mainly due to lie-ins and easy access to snacks (ha-ha), but it does come with its downsides. Not being able to quickly speak to other developers or show each other what we\\\'re working on makes it harder to get stuff done. We\\\'re exploring several apps and programs to minimize this, but you can\\\'t beat being in the same room.Life balance:Outside of work, the lockdown really hasn\\\'t affected me too much, as I\\\'m one of the lucky ones who isn\\\'t bothered by being locked in. I moved house just before the lockdown started, so I\\\'ve been hanging out with my new housemates and their cat, whom I pay tribute to in the form of pets every time I pass through Her domain (stairs, hallway, kitchen\\xe2\\x80\\xa6)Declarative prologue. The team have been hugely busy this month working on a \\xe2\\x80\\x98vertical slice\\xe2\\x80\\x99 of Kenshi 2, which I have the pleasure of sharing snippets of today. For those unaware of the terminology, a vertical slice is a portion of near-finished quality game which then allows a studio to visualise some of what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re up to. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s traditionally distinct from a prototype in that the quality is much higher leaving less room for flexibility but for us we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re blurring that line a bit and using it primarily as a tangible design tool. Internally nicknamed \\xe2\\x80\\x98Concrete Neon\\xe2\\x80\\x99, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about having a space to test and iterate on some of Kenshi 2\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ideas by taking them away from a design document and experiencing how they might actually be played. Sharing some thoughts on our first major milestone, Chris compares Concrete Neon to founding Kenshi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Holy Nation and his hands on approach to game design: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnyone who played the [Kenshi 1 early access] map in it\\\'s earliest incarnation will remember that only a small area around the holy nation was active, the rest was greyed-out and you couldn\\\'t go there, because it wasn\\\'t finished.  This gives us a test bed to get everything working early on so we can play the game and experiment.  I\\\'m not a very formal designer, my technique is iterative because my \\xe2\\x80\\x98special skill\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is playing a game for a while and then going ""hunger needs to be 0.8x slower and strength needs to raise 1.12x faster instead of 1.08x"".  It\\\'s also better that way because I can approach the design as a player rather than as a game designer.  I don\\\'t like game designers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d---This month\\xe2\\x80\\x99s blog post was intended for last so ran a little late, but we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d love to hear your thoughts in the comments \\xe2\\x80\\x93 with so many players following different game development projects it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great place to reflect. As ever you can join us on Twitter and Facebook[www.facebook.com] where we still have an upcoming creator competition to announce once we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve worked out the prizes... If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like a none-Steam way to keep up with the studio, blogs are available on our website[lofigames.com] and via our mailing list[eepurl.com].Cheers,"

32,bug,March Community Update,Apr 20,"In this month\\xe2\\x80\\x99s community update we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re working from home, welcoming several new hires to Lo-Fi and learning a bit more about performance considerations in Kenshi 2.Developing from a safe locationAs represented through parody on our Instagram[www.instagram.com], we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re encouraging everyone to stay at home if they can and as no exceptions to the rule, everyone at Lo-Fi has been working remotely. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s taken us a little while to adjust but we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re now fully in the swing of things; our latest series of Kenshi 1 bug fixes have just been deployed to the stable branch and Kenshi 2 progress marches on. Welcome reinforcementsTo continue ramping up development for Kenshi 2 we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re excited to introduce some new faces to the team (starting remotely of course). Already hard at work, Victor Goossens, is our new Technical Artist and Sarah Keates[www.instagram.com], our new Office Administrator \\xe2\\x80\\x93 both of which bring more structure to our workflow in the studio. Additionally over the next few weeks we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re welcoming Mohammad Rezazadeh[www.artstation.com] as our Lead 3D Artist and Craig Tinney, as a Junior Programmer, each adding additional talent to push Kenshi 2 forward. Finally, with the popularity of the waterways picture shared in a previous update, fans will be happy to welcome back well known freelance artist Calum Alexander Watt.Technically art or Artfully technical?Joining us this month, Victor gives a better explanation of what a technical artist does along with a sneak peak of work that would make Bob Ross proud:\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHi guys! I\\\'m Victor, or Mr4Goosey (after my last name, Goossens)! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m happy to say I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m Lo-Fi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s new Technical Artist (I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll call it TA for short, so that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stand for Teaching Assistant here). Most of you are probably not really sure what that means, though. In a nutshell, my job as a Technical Artist is to be a bridge between the art department and the programming department. I do artsy things that are too technical for the artists, and I do technical things that are too artsy for the programmers.I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been doing indie-development on all kinds of projects for years now. I got into game development as a programmer, but quickly developed a passion for creating beautiful things \\xe2\\x80\\x93 bringing me to the specialized niche that is Technical Art. Most of the work I do relates somehow to what your graphics card is doing while you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re playing games; I handle lighting, all kinds of color-balancing, and most importantly, I deal with shaders, the \\xe2\\x80\\x98code\\xe2\\x80\\x99 that tells your graphics card what every pixel on your screen should look like. Having specialized in Unreal Engine 4, a lot of the shader-work I do is actually material-based (using UE4\\xe2\\x80\\x99s node system). That doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t necessarily make the job much simpler (you still need to understand how rendering engines and graphics cards work), but definitely a bit easier to understand at a basic level. I also work with artists to work out any kinks in their work flow, as well as dealing with performance-budgets and optimization.You might now be wondering what that means for Kenshi in the larger scheme of things. As you guys probably know we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve decided to move to Unreal Engine 4 for Kenshi 2. Having years of experience in UE4, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be working to smooth out the transition from Ogre, helping the team get used to Unreal\\xe2\\x80\\x99s way of working. Unreal Engine 4 has an incredibly powerful and versatile rendering engine \\xe2\\x80\\x93 if you know how to work with it, because that power comes at the cost of complexity. The plan is for Kenshi 2 to be graphically above and beyond anything we could ever do in Ogre, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m here to make sure that we can actually pull that off. An easy example for that is what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m actually working on right now:Kenshi 2\\xe2\\x80\\x99s new Time-of-Day system, and primarily, its clouds! Kenshi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fully dynamic lighting and environment is a massive challenge to represent properly, and it means things like clouds just cannot be left static. Kenshi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s new clouds grow, move and morph over time \\xe2\\x80\\x93 all without melting your graphics card! Next up is just about every other material in Kenshi...\\xe2\\x80\\x9dThe final pieceLast but not least, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re still searching for a lead programmer to join us[lofigames.com], keeping us on track to complete Kenshi 2 before all of this apocalypse malarkey.

33,bug,February Community Update,Mar 16,"In this month\\xe2\\x80\\x99s community update we wanted to acknowledge teaming up on the trailer, share some important news regarding the recent Korean translation, and provide some more details on what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on with Kenshi 2.New TrailerAt the end of January we contacted Kokoplays to work with us on a new video that would coincide with our latest patch. The main aim was to give potential players an honest look at the game and an overview of what publications and users think of it. If you missed it, check it out below:We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re incredibly pleased to see all the positive comments about the result, making it a notable entry for our new YouTube channel which also offers Japanese, Chinese and Korean versions of the same video. In future we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to do more collaborative projects with members of the community, level up awesome ideas that might otherwise stay on the drawing board, and celebrate alongside the fans that make Kenshi great.Korean Translation updateAt the end of last month we pushed a patch with a number of bug fixes alongside the official support for Korean language text, thanks to detailed user feedback and the assistance of a freelance third party to verify, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been made aware that the quality of this translation hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t met a standard we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re happy with. Our current plan is to revisit this translation with a much stronger emphasis on context and error checking to update it as soon as possible, current projections put this at around 10 weeks. Unfortunately this has also lead us to reconsider Korean social media efforts. In the meantime, Korean Twitter and Facebook[www.facebook.com] coverage is set to continue for at least another month, keeping users updated on the status of the translation.Korean Wiki \\xe2\\x80\\x93 looking for editorsOn a more positive note, due to the popularity of Wikis in eastern gaming communities we worked with a member of our existing English Fandom Wiki team to start up a Korean version, mirroring a number of key pages to assist new users. With the initial setup out of the way we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re now looking for Korean community members to take over. The Korean Wiki can be found here[kenshi.fandom.com]GUI DevelopmentIn the interests of shedding more light on the Kenshi 2 progress from the technical team, this month we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re sharing some thoughts on the ongoing work underpinning GUI development directly from programmer Harrison:\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHey, im Harrison aka Boodals, the newest programmer at LoFi. Ever since I was first hired in November, I\\\'ve been working on remaking the GUIs from Kenshi 1 in Unreal Engine for Kenshi 2. Its too early in development to know everything that the GUIs need to be able to do, so we\\\'re just copying the designs (graphics & layout) from K1, and focusing entirely on getting the functionality working so we can test things. That means they currently look like uglier versions of the K1 GUIs, so there\\\'s no point in showing any pictures yet, somebody will make them look pretty at some point in the future.The GUIs in Kenshi 1 were made using a programming library called MyGUI, which allows modders to reskin GUIs, and move individual GUI elements (buttons, text, sliders, etc) around by changing specific files. However, the GUI\\\'s functionality was hard-coded in the game\\\'s source code, which cannot be changed by modders. This means you cannot make a mod which adds a new button, only change what every button looks like, or move existing buttons around.For Kenshi 2, we are using Unreal Engine which comes with it\\\'s own GUI system called Unreal Motion Graphics, or UMG for short. UMG is tied closely to Unreal\\\'s Blueprint scripting system, which is used to give the GUIs functionality.We don\\\'t entirely know how modding will work for K2, but when we looked at other Unreal games that allow modding (such as ARK: Survival Evolved), both UMG and Blueprint is completely available. So in theory, modders will be able to change the game\\\'s GUIs, and script them to be able to do just about anything. This is in addition to the Forgotten Construction Set, so mods that add or change weapons, armour, items, buildings, and most other things in K1 will still be possible.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dHarrison first took up coding to make mods for various games before pursuing it as a career choice, which gives us another great point of insight as we make a conscious effort to support the community\\xe2\\x80\\x99s efforts again in Kenshi 2.Materials ResearchElsewhere in the programming team, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been an ongoing investigation of Unreal\\xe2\\x80\\x99s material system[docs.unrealengine.com] which governs a huge number of visual elements and object interactions. Ranging from basic properties such as colour and transparency to complex physics based lighting and weather functions. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not just aiming to step up the visual quality in Kenshi 2, it also gives us a great opportunity to make the world itself feel more dynamic (which is part of what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pushed us to search for a full time technical artist). Finally, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a whole lot more going on behind the scenes with other members of the programming and art teams for Kenshi 2; all of which would be working closely with the successful applicants for each of the roles we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re hiring for[lofigames.com]. On the topic of abstract studio stuff, we also fixed some of the stranger behaviour with the sign-ups for our mailing list[eepurl.com] meaning we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll look for more excuses to use it in the near future, also making it a great alternative way of getting these news posts for fans of Kenshi that prefer to stay outside of Steam\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ecosystem.

43,feature,May Community Update,Jun 15,"Hi all, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s past time for another instalment of Kenshi development updates. As our second entry while working from home and with several new members of staff joining the team there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been a significant amount of \\xe2\\x80\\x98onboarding\\xe2\\x80\\x99 this month. To start I wanted to go over two ongoing major localisation projects and a recent virtual event for Kenshi. Lastly, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re sharing updates on Kenshi 2, taking this month to talk a bit more about the narrative and technical sides of building a large sandbox.   Localising KenshiIn the past we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve spoken about our passion for providing Kenshi in other languages, but we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve rarely delved into exactly what that entails. As two major languages are still due to be re-released, along with this month\\xe2\\x80\\x99s progress update it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good chance for us to touch on the concept of translation vs localisation. As any animation or foreign cinema fan would attest to, finding the nearest equivalent word to throw on a subtitle track is a very hit and miss experience. Often when a language is spoken, we use sayings and euphemisms to communicate a certain meaning that resonates with one culture but, even if translated, might be completely meaningless in another. On the simpler side, for anyone in their mid-20\\xe2\\x80\\x99s that grew up with the English dub of Pok\\xc3\\xa9mon here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a \\xe2\\x80\\x98jellydonut\\xe2\\x80\\x99.Except that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actually onigiri[en.wikipedia.org] or rice balls. As the western audience would have been unlikely to eat rice balls a decision was made to dub them as donuts and call it a day. A much closer cultural equivalence would have been something along the lines of a sandwich, dumpling, or pasty. None of that covers the visual side of what fans see on Ash\\xe2\\x80\\x99s adventure so at best it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still a very crude way of trying to relate that Brock was nice enough to pack some lunch for their journey. If you understand that and are now thinking what they could have done instead then congratulations, you just took a crash course in localisation. In Kenshi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s upcoming Japanese localisation, a lot of corrections have been made to dialogue that baffled Japanese players. For example, currently some ironies are translated with opposite meanings which leads to confusion when players need to make dialogue choices. Similarly, Meg has been replacing nonsensical direct translations with their Japanese equivalent phrases, e.g. the current \\\'eat boots\\\' is now correctly translated as \\\'kick your ass\\\'. Work is also being done to change proverbs that made no sense in Japanese culture. Players won\\\'t see \\\'out of the frying pan\\\' in the middle of conversation (referring to \\\'out of frying pan into the fire\\\') and will instead find a Japanese equivalent saying for a worsening situation. All this amounts to a near complete rewrite of our current Japanese text and requires a degree of thoughtful research - it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a very time-consuming process.Meanwhile, for the Korean localisation, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve recently released a major update. As we mentioned before we revisited it with a different team, but we also decided to collaborate with fan Jeffrey Jeoung to assist with quality assurance. This helped us by breaking through the language barrier which prevented us from otherwise checking on the quality of translations. Kenshi x Indie Live ExpoA quiet side effect of the ongoing current pandemic is the effect it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s having on live events across game development, whilst not as pressing of a concern as many other topics it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easy to forget we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in the middle of the busy season for live expos. Lo-Fi is excited to share, following the positive outcome of our last physical event in Shanghai, we worked with PLAYISM again to take part in our first digital event \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Indie Live Expo 2020[indie.live-expo.games]. Hosted by the famous Ryu\\xe2\\x80\\x99sOffice[ryusoffice.co.jp] in Japan, live streams were broadcast in English, Japanese and Chinese with aims \\xe2\\x80\\x98to promote friendship, fellowship, and enthusiasm through the medium of video games.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 A cause we were more than happy to add weight to.The event covered a range of different indie titles and initiatives including personal messages from beloved industry figures ZUN[en.touhouwiki.net] (Touhou Project[en.wikipedia.org]), Toby Fox[en.wikipedia.org] (Undertale[undertale.com], Deltarune[www.deltarune.com]) SWERY[en.wikipedia.org] (The GoodLife / White Owls Inc.[www.whiteowls.co.jp]) and KazuyaNino[www.animenewsnetwork.com] (TYPE-MOON[en.wikipedia.org]).

Just communication.Similar to the real world, Kenshi 2 is going to be pretty big. Previously when talking to Nat she confirmed that whilst we still don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a marketing friendly measured size to rally behind, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be bigger than Kenshi 1. This raises two important questions: how do we make it feel alive and how will it work from a technical standpoint? Below Nat touches on the first point and the magic of the \\xe2\\x80\\x98narrative bark\\xe2\\x80\\x99. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHello! For the last few months, I\\\'ve been working on the little pieces of information that subtly unfold the various histories and cultures of Kenshi\\\'s world. Writing for a sandbox game can be a little different to other RPGs where the developers normally have more control over what the player hears and sees (and even what the NPCs do!). So, for Kenshi, I need to reflect the necessary information differently while also making sure the world feels alive and immersive.A few months back, I talked about roughly structuring our first factions\\\' layouts on the world map, but now my job is to zone in on the individual cities and their own mini conflicts. I\\\'ve been planning out what I like to call the \\\'Carrots\\\' - the local goals or tempting secrets for the player to explore. I then list out all the possible ways I can convey that information, using in-game item descriptions and different dialogues, or visually with assets.  We\\\'re strictly against traditional quest systems in Kenshi, so it\\\'s important for me to tell the player what they can do indirectly through the environment instead, planting seeds in your minds and making you want to do things for yourselves.One of those \\\'dribbles\\\' of information involves writing dialogue Barks. Barks are the short bits of dialogue that NPCs blurt out either in reaction to something, or just completely ambient comments - the ambient comments are the ones that I\\\'ve been writing and they\\\'re perfect for breathing life into a world, reinforcing goals and lore, and simply interacting with the player to really make them feel part of the world. BUT... I have to write a lot of those suckas while actually keeping them interesting and nonintrusive. They can be a bit mind numbing to work on but they\\\'re one of my favourite methods to paint a picture of a town via gossiping and general musings from citizens.If you\\\'d like to read more about my process with writing barks, I\\\'ve written a much more in-depth article on gamasutra[www.gamasutra.com] or you can follow me on Twitter\\xe2\\x80\\x9dBeautiful World.As readers already know, Kenshi 2 is in development using Unreal Engine 4 which is a major jump from an aging implementation of OGRE. Following on from the narrative elements of the world, Victor, our technical artist, has kindly offered to answer some questions about the technical aspects.Starting with a major pain point then, moving across large areas in Kenshi 1 leads to lots of \\xe2\\x80\\x98loading\\xe2\\x80\\x99 pauses. How does Unreal handle huge maps and will that help with this?\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUE4 has a system called World Composition - it allows us to divide the world into cells which are then automatically loaded as the camera approaches them. It can do that asynchronously, meaning it doesn\\\'t lock up the game; it\\\'s loading the data as a background task. We can divide buildings and such over these cells in order to keep them unloaded and have them automatically come in when needed. World Composition is also built to work with Unreal Engine\\\'s Landscape system. Unfortunately, the stock Landscape system isn\\\'t explicitly designed for a world as massive as Kenshi 2. While we still intend to use world composition, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s additional exploration going into third party options for the landscape system to go even further. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important for us to get this right as currently Kenshi 2\\\'s world is expected to end up even bigger than Kenshi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ~1000km2.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pretty huge, I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think of that many other games with similar scale. I appreciate it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not your field, but will World Composition mean no more units running into the sky?\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIdeally, but this also relates to pathing. We haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t finalised exactly how pathing will be handled in Kenshi 2, but our current expectation is that we\\\'ll be working with Recast (UE4\\\'s stock navmesh which is well-tested and reliable). So tentatively, no more people walking off into the big blue yonder. UE4 and Recast allow us to generate the navmesh where we need it with a large amount of flexibility, and it should, theoretically, handle our world really well. Either way, I\\\'m confident we\\\'ll have a lot less weird pathing going on than we do in the original game.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve mentioned streaming bits of world in and unloading it on the fly but let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s talk about building larger spaces. In talks from Unreal Fest it seemed like developers can make presets for objects or types of buildings, set the area boundaries then let the engine create an entire city for them to edit. Do we have anything like that helping us with Kenshi 2?\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThings like city-spawners are something that we can use, but because of the oddities about Kenshi\\\'s world and a bunch of specifics, we also can\\\'t rely on a generalised system. If we do want to end up using things like generators, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be developing a tool internally. One other big problem with these sorts of things is that if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s relied on too much then the world ends up feeling \\xe2\\x80\\x98same-y\\xe2\\x80\\x99.On the other hand, while it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lot of work for an artist to go through and manually put all the buildings and pots and pans in the right spot, it means they really are in a spot that does them justice. We do use modular (re-useable) pieces where we can, but we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re being careful with not overdoing them, after all we want Kenshi 2\\xe2\\x80\\x99s world to feel unique and distinct.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dWhat about when adding details to natural biomes?\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNatural environments are a lot easier to automate with those kinds of tools \\xe2\\x80\\x93 at least for the menial stuff like grass placement. Of course, we could manually position every blade of grass, but that would be a nightmare. What we actually do is procedurally place grass in the right spots determined by our level designer. There are also other procedural tools we can easily integrate into our workflow for natural assets \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for example Unreal has native Speedtree integration. Speedtree is a tool that allows us to make foliage \\xe2\\x80\\x9cspecies\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and generate as many unique trees in that species as we want. It makes the foliage-creation a lot less tedious than needing to manually model them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dIf everything is going to be nicely dressed up, how do you deal with performance hits for all that extra detail? \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor starters, Kenshi 1 didn\\\'t use LODs (dynamic changes in level of detail) which meant operating with a massively constrained tri-budget for near-camera-detail. Kenshi 2 make heavy use of LODs, and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re massively helped in that area by UE4\\\'s semi-automatic LOD generation systems. Essentially, we can have extra detailed meshes up-close, and turn them into simpler low-detail meshes when they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re further away. This all happens without any extra work on the artist\\\'s end.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dSo that covers some basic software optimisations, what about from a hardware perspective - Kenshi runs an older version of OGRE that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s famously single threaded so what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the difference with Unreal and Kenshi 2?\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a huge shift here, really. When Kenshi development started, multi-threaded CPUs really weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t that common yet, nor were the cores nearly as fast as they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re becoming now. For context, at the time Intel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s i3/i5/i7 release scheme didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even exist. In development, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important to work on systems that help as many people as reasonably possible to be able to play - Back then that meant there was no reason to go beyond a single-thread. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an incredibly complicated thing to code so it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worth the development time.That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s different now, even the average user runs 4 CPU cores. Unreal Engine, by default, runs its render-thread on a separate core. Kenshi 2 runs almost all of its logic on extra threads, of which there are now more, and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re faster. The gains made by proper multi-threading are massive at this point. Another thing which makes a big difference is that so many rendering-bottlenecks of the past decade have gone from being handled on the CPU to being on the GPU, which is significantly faster for calculations that need to happen hundreds of thousands of times per frame. GPUs have gotten exponentially faster over the past decade, and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s power we can properly tap into.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dA lot of this works on paper but what can you do to know if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re getting it right as it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being made?\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis sort of thing is for a large part just developing some sort of instinct for what you should and shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do. If you show me the profiler statistics for a given scene, along with a wireframe, I can generally pretty quickly figure out where any slowdowns are coming from. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s difficult to explain why in each case, that goes incredibly deep, but you get a feel for the patterns of what works and what consequences certain choices have.During initial development, you work on rough ideas, generally without hugging tight performance limits for everything. Once something\\xe2\\x80\\x99s working, then it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time to start looking whether the current cost is reasonable, and where you can easily scrape some frame time off it. The big analytical guns come out when you run into major performance problems. Generally, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a certain benchmark you want to hit for acceptable performance at minimum specs. Once you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re unable to hit that benchmark, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time to stare at lots-and-lots of numbers \\xe2\\x80\\x93 indicators of how costly parts of a scene are \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and go through what you can deduce from them.  Starting with the worst offenders, you \\xe2\\x80\\x98scrape some stuff off\\xe2\\x80\\x99, ever more aggressively. Optimisation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s basically a circle, it repeats as you go. Scenes keep growing and therefore getting more expensive, so you work your ass off to make sure you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re still meeting the benchmark by tearing the existing stuff apart more. The scene grows again and the cycle repeats.Finally, Epic just announced Unreal 5[www.unrealengine.com], as it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supposedly seamless to migrate there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s talk of us moving along with it. Are there any features that you saw and immediately thought \\xe2\\x80\\x98that would be perfect for Kenshi\\xe2\\x80\\x99?\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs a technical artist, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m incredibly excited to see what Unreal Engine 5 will bring us. If it delivers everything Epic has been marketing so far such as the lighting and geometry changes, it could be a massive game-changer. That said, we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how the final implementation will turn out so we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t count on it yet. The promotional material stresses that porting should be easy, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m confident it will be, but based on current information swapping from UE4 to UE5 won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t automatically mean much. The major gains with the new tech aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t user-oriented, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re things that will make a massive difference for the art creation workflow and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re already in the middle of that. We also can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work according to the new idealised workflow either. Obviously, as it wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be worthwhile to sit here twiddling our thumbs until UE5 comes out and make everything then, the current plan is to just continue developing as before and see what we can do when it arrives.Speculating on a hypothetical Kenshi 3 though\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 I imagine our workflow would be fundamentally different using UE5 as compared to our current art-pipelines, and I imagine it\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be significantly more time-efficient. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all very speculative though, so don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get too excited.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--- This month\\xe2\\x80\\x99s blog was a lengthy undertaking so I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m looking forward to hearing thoughts and questions from the community in the comments. As ever you can join us on Twitter and Facebook[www.facebook.com] where we have a soon-to-be-confirmed creator competition in the works. If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like a none-Steam way to keep up with the studio, blogs are available on our website[lofigames.com] and via our mailing list[eepurl.com].Cheers,"
44,feature,6,Kenshi\\\'s community can decide the fate of an Unreal Engine port,"Kenshi, Lo-Fi Games' eccentric sandbox RPG, left Early Access almost a year ago, but the developer has started work on a new version. This has become a distraction from work on Kenshi 2, however, so Lo-Fi Games' CEO is asking the community to help him decide how to proceed. Lo-Fi recently announced that it's switched to Unreal Engine 4, touting better graphics, performance, new features like cloth physics and other improvements. This isn't just for the sequel, either, which was announced back in March. Porting the original Kenshi's assets and trying to make them work with Unreal is now taking up more time than creating Kenshi 2, and Hunt's not certain it's worth it. ""Personally I feel like it would be better to focus on Kenshi 2, which will have exciting new features, new content and world to explore and mechanics to play with, rather than remaking kenshi 1, which would be essentially the same game.""You can leave a comment here and vote in this poll if you've got a preference. The original is, despite being a bit rough, already great, so it seems like Lo-Fi's energy would be better spent on making the sequel—but maybe you think differently. "
45,feature,Kenshi 2 is already in development,"Mar 21, 2019","Kenshi took developer Lo-Fi Games around 12 years to create, and it finally left Early Access in December. It's great—just give our Kenshi review a read—and more than a bit weird. And a follow-up to the massive post-apocalyptic sandbox is already in development. The Kenshi 2 announcement was made without much fanfare, hidden away in the Steam updates and announcements forum (cheers, ResetEra). Lo-Fi was planning on working in peace without the pressure that comes from announcing a new game, but pressure from another direction made the developer reconsider.""Our original plan was to keep the new project quiet so we could work on it without public pressure and then do a big press release when we had something to show,"" studio founder Chris Hunt explains. ""However it seems lots of people are getting confused or angry about us not still tinkering with Kenshi or leaving the world of Kenshi behind, so I'm going to go ahead and announce early what we are working on now, as I think it will put most people at ease.""Kenshi 2 will be set before the first game, a whole 1,000 years earlier, letting Lo-Fi dig into the world's history. This is when the Old Empire was apparently top dog. That's the ancient civilisation whose ruins you'll find scattered around Kenshi, so presumably we'll be taking a trip back to before the apocalypse. It will use the same engine as the first game, though it's being upgraded for performance. The upgrade will benefit the original Kenshi, too, as it will be applied as a free update. Other features could also be shared across the games. ""Why keep the same engine? Because a completely new engine would break everything and take another million years to finish,"" says Hunt. ""By sticking with the same code we are making the decision to prioritise gameplay instead of graphics. (Not to mention a much faster release date).""What that release date will be is still a mystery. Probably sooner than 2030, though. "
