0,crash,[DFC] Itnetlolor,"Sep 4, 2014 @ 10:26pmÂ ","Being penalized by score per-crash, but not breaking the game/song would be a more fair mode to it. Zen Mode of that would be no score being submitted, but would still show up for the curious (and despite crashes). We can keep these original settings for challenging/gamer difficulty, and hardcore would be more like AAAAaaaaAAAAaaaa, and one-hit-kill.For story purposes, you\\\'re wearing special protective ""D-Phaze Gear"" or something. Not as impressive (harder difficulties give higher scores, because, you know, your life\\\'s at stake here, and you\\\'re deciding to put your life on the line), but at least you don\\\'t have to worry about that PB&J in a can you call your head being blended like a milkshake anytime soon. Plus, you\\\'re falling for fun, and bieng one with the breeze (kinda the point of Zen), who cares whether you drop dead or not by the end, or on the way?Should fall within the general brand of humor these games have, at least. It also explains the difficulty ratings, what and how they provide, and why casual/zen mode would be like it is, and why hardcore gives you only one chance."
1,crash,"Feb 14, 2014 @ 8:43pm",So like I just played this...and it was a thing.,"Like, wow.  Last time I played this it was during the potato game thing.  It was...quite ugly.On a whim, I decided to install and play it today for the cards(which is totally why you buy and play games, as they are clearly not enjoyable at all, right?).  And I quickly found out to my pleasent surprise that not only is there an actual game to be found here, it also looks to be shaping up to be pretty awesome.  Needs a lot more content still, but what\\\'s here feels fun, challenging, and makes me want to play it again.Which is good, because I suck at keeping my face from crashing into the simplest of geometry, apparently.Anyway, thought you developer folks might like to know that I am sitting here, enjoying your strange form of entertainment you call a video game, and rocking to songs and such.I have yet to attempt The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy: Episode 1(the radio show).  I\\\'m not sure I have the nerves/skills needed for such a long venture with only three hits.  Maybe a later date.----A bit of feedback:-When none of the objectives for a level are done yet, can the retry button be a bit more shiny?  I keep accidently clicking ""back to menu"" on the scores screen, which means I get to then wait for the level to generate itself instead of getting the quick ""rebuilding level"" load time.  It\\\'s just so tiny and small and down there.  I understand the logic of having the back to menu being more prominent(since when we play our own songs, we probably are more likely to want to change tracks then play the same level again), but the story objectives often need several runs to get a good one going.-Also, most of the main menu does nothing.  I\\\'m guessing this is known already though.-I have also found that pressing esc twice ends the game.  While this is a nice ""Boss is coming, look busy"" mode, it fails to come back to life due to the exiting of the exe.  Perhaps quitting should be put on some sort of pause menu like other less ""Boss is coming"" games?-I am loving the hack mechanic, and that you can tap Spacebar to do it as well.  It\\\'s much simpler then the hectic double action spray/thumbs up/thumbs down in Aaaa, while still needing attention and skill to plan a run for the most of them.-For that matter, keep the A and D keys rotating as well.  I actually am finding myself using both keys and the mouse buttons interchangably when playing.  It feels really good that both inputs work and do what I think they should be doing.-I\\\'m not all sure how skimming things works, or how the hit meter/multiplier and such work.  Could use a bit more explaining as the scores seem to involve this meter and I\\\'m currently not sure what the game expects me to try besides sailing near buildings and collecting objects.-I\\\'ve seen that there seems to be some points or charge up sound for sailing along something with the bottom screen lined up to the surface.  There\\\'s no current explanation for what this does however, and whatever it is, it\\\'s subtle enough where I have yet to figure it out.  I gather it\\\'s supposed to be a good thing.  -More single player preselected track content teaching scoring techniques would probably help tremendously.That\\\'s it for now.  Rock on guys, this is some sort of game now, and it\\\'s shaping up to be pretty cool."
2,crash,"Oct 1, 2013 @ 9:13am","Music file browser stuck, need help!","I got to city 4 for the first time, and the music file browser popped up asking me to select a song. I navigated to my personal music folder, and then the file browser completely hung with the spinning hexagon. It\\\'s been twenty minutes and it\\\'s still spinning. This particular folder has thousands of songs in it and I think the game is trying to scan each one and getting stuck. If I back out of the level and try and go back in, the game crashes.I understand now there\\\'s a folder in steamapps/123kickit where I can drop my music. The problem is now the music file browser ""remembers"" where I last told it to go, so it keeps trying to scan again and gets stuck again.I\\\'ve tried deleting the game and re-installing, I\\\'ve even tried manually deleting everything in the folder and doing a cache verification, but it still remembers the last location. It still remembers which levels I\\\'ve completed too, so it must not have wiped properly.Is there: a) a way to reset the game completely and utterly 100% from scratch?b) a way to reset the file browser to start pointing at its default location again?"
3,crash,"Oct 19, 2013 @ 4:17am",New Review 3.0(?),"So, as ever, I wanted to give people (and maybe if they\\\'re reading - the developers) a quick insight into what I thought, as I\\\'ve been following this for a good few months now and returned to it after the latest update...Firstly, to avoid scouring through my ramblings - the obvious glitches / bugs...The multiplier. It\\\'s broken. If you crash into walls it goes up and if you keep on flying and not hitting anything, it goes down. Clearly it was programmed so that when you fly into \\\'collectibles\\\' it goes up... but it also works when you hit something!Second glitch? Collectibles. When you auto-generate a level with your music; 5.6, 3.2 open worlds in particular - there aren\\\'t any. So no multiplier. Unless you hit walls and then get some.Final gripe? ""return to desktop"" - argh, after each level you go back to main menu, have to log in again and then scroll to where you were.. not ideal!Oh and side point gripe - WASD - wasn\\\'t a problem except it didn\\\'t work! WS up and and down did - left/right I had to use mouse buttons, but I mapped everything via Pinnacle and used controller - much more fun that way!Okay..Onto the levels...Certainly the game has never looked better, 3.1 is amazing with the flying traffic, 5.0 looks lovely and there are some great ideas in 5.2. I do like the tunnel of 5.4 - but slightly repetitive and the colour of the tunnel, seems to jar with the neon stuff inside (it almost looks like an old empty picture frame..) but that might be just me..I see we\\\'ve gone from ""the world reacting to your music"" i.e. pulsing to the beat, colours changing, etc. to ""the world generated by your music"" - more like Space Invaders Infinity - which is kind of fine by me, but not really what was suggested when I got it, no biggie though, but there\\\'s now zero connection to what you\\\'re listening to and the blocks around you, which makes the levels feel a little lifeless to be honest. They\\\'re missing that crazy pulsing equaliser type effect.. but still very playable!5.0 looks nice but not much to do same with 5.6 - I assume the V.01 and V.2 are to progress some kind of story as there\\\'s literally nothing to do in those... I would have liked to play my music on all the levels - just for the variety (I swear if I have to listen to \\\'future shock\\\' one more time I may have to go on a retro city rampage) but the shame of that is 3.0 level is actually fun and there\\\'s more to do in that (on mute) than a lot of the other levels...And that\\\'s my biggest gripe I guess, it\\\'s never looked lovelier, it\\\'s never been slicker, the addition of collectibles is GREAT - love that for the multiplier idea (once fixed) - I like the fact it\\\'s harder to get grinds against walls, I like using a controller, it gives a wobbliness to controls so you can\\\'t be so exact, I like the new menu systems, there\\\'s a lot there I like (new aesthetics / blocks look lovely, the backgrounds are great) - it\\\'s all very nice.. and you know there\\\'s a ""but"" coming... this iteration really has the least amount of player interaction in what you can do WITHIN LEVELS - and that\\\'s the worrying thing... I auto-generated a good few levels with different songs and it generally ended up being a block of squares in the middle of the screen or the tunnel (oh yes, tunnel \\\'glitch\\\' is that you can\\\'t collect your score in the square tunnels until you fly out as it keeps adding to your score, no chance to actually collect points you\\\'ve earned - a bit odd)... so yes... great progress technically, but from a player\\\'s point of view, several steps back... and now no connection to music / level, I\\\'m not sure how this can be marketed... or it\\\'ll need to be marketed slightly differently...Will I stick with it? Of course! I want to see how it grows! Will I be getting Audiosurf 2 to see how levels link with music? I\\\'m afraid so... I didn\\\'t want to, 1,2,3 isn\\\'t quite giving me what it put on the can at the start, but it\\\'s certainly a fun diversion... and well worth purchasing, as long as you understand what you\\\'re getting.."

5,crash,"Jul 22, 2013 @ 1:08pm",Azumi\\\'s Impenetrable Juggernaut Wingsuit,"As the name implies, Azumi Pentak is a juggernaut with her self-printed wingsuit.Right now, she can smash through buildings with no percieved injury as if they were paper, destroying them completely. I find this a tad unrealistic for my tastes and would appreciate either a harsher penalty aside from a simple multiplier decrease, or maybe a hardcore mode not unlike ""AAAA! - Reckless Disregard"", where crashing into a building results in a bone-crunching game over.I really believe this difficulty increase would help the ugly babies crap themselves in flight and learn how to control themselves better when performing stunts."
6,crash,"Jul 8, 2013 @ 1:36am",Strong Edges are Great Feedback,"""Quick"" list of feedbackI\\\'ve noticed that the times where Ugly Baby really shines for me is when there\\\'s a lot of direct feedback from the song. The most immediate example being level 3.1 where the light flashes with strong sounds like cymbal crashes, and in general when I notice that the level is being built to the beat. I hope to see more direct responses like that.I have a love/hate relationship with the way the levels change tone with the song. On the one hand, I think it\\\'s amazing because it\\\'s there and occasionally it changes perfectly with the song, and provides the same immediate feedback like the kind I get from 3.1\\\'s lights. On the other hand, it really bums me out when the change happens too late or too early.Tl;DR (paragraph), the shifts are great, but I hope you guys can polish the timing a bit more.Another touch I like is when I pass cars or gain a multiplier. They both sound great, but I\\\'ve found that they work best when I see them leading up to and following a quiet moment (read; second or two) in the song and the sound effect pierces through and reminds me that I\\\'m playing a game, not listening to my iPod.Favorite levels in decreasing order: 3.1, 3.2, 4, 3.3Why? Well, I like how 3.1 is constant action and it really is a challenge to try to get points while avoiding buildings (and the aforementioned light effects). 3.2 is fun because of the variety in the level and because I like the feedback the flying cars tend to give. 4 is hit and miss for me as sometimes it just gives me a boring path to follow down the middle, and otherwise is just really sparse; making it difficult to keep my multiplier. I don\\\'t really like 3.3 because I like levels that I can rotate freely, and the wall that tends to form feels like a forced path. The way it tends to force me towards the ""outskirts"" is also fairly annoying. Maybe if there were more gaps to squeeze through near the middle I\\\'d enjoy it more.I know that the game\\\'s premise is falling, but without anything to tell me which way is up, I might as well be flying in space. Something as simple as some signs or flying text on the walls facing up would probably improve that (maybe, I don\\\'t know).*edit* By facing up, I mean the way we normally place signs and propaganda, not floating like they are in levels 1-3.Side note: what determines how long the scoring system goes offline when you hit something? As far as I can tell it\\\'s completely random."
7,crash,"Jun 28, 2013 @ 4:12pm",Can\\\'t find my old thread - so here\\\'s my third update!!!,"Well....Where to start...We\\\'ve travelled through virtually no visual feedback from grinds, etc. (buzzes?) to points on screen, more psychedlic backdrops and now the latest iteration!Again...Who am I to comment? (36 years old, had a C64, played games from Mastertronic to Ocean, to Dreamcast, SNES, Gamecube, PS1, 2 and 3, Xbox and 360, and now disillusiioned with consoles, back to my motherland, the PC....?)THIS!Whatever version it is!It\\\'s certainly different!We\\\'ve gone from very retro graphics (solid block colours) to textures, words, and allsorts!Firstly...Storywise... sorry, no, doesn\\\'t work for me, I honestly don\\\'t think you need to wrap this game up in such stuff, she almost reminded me of Mirror\\\'s Edge.. and no, so... no...Secondly... you have the retro grinding effects vs textured objects - very jarring... personally I think it looks cleaner and more distintictive as solid blocks, Tron-like, I\\\'m not a fan of generic looking blocks...Thirdly (I\\\'ll stop counting now, sounds a bit shirty!) it all seems so remote from the music to gameplay ratio that I gave up from 3.0... (and I\\\'ve played every iteration since I bought and will continue to do so) - it kind of a) didn\\\'t let me play my own music from the start.. b) didn\\\'t relate to the songs it was playing really.. (which was surprising) and c) just seemed to create a massive disconnect for me (maybe because I\\\'ve played previous versions?)I kind of just wanted to jump back in, see the new stuff with my music and see how well you\\\'d matched the backgrounds to it... but that wasn\\\'t the point I guess with this update!Erm...What else?I was thinking... you know what would make an amazing \\\'connect\\\' to the game and the background and all the rest of it? 3rd person. At the moment you\\\'re just a dot on the screen, a target, a crosshair, nothing you do relates to anything...Maybe for this, and continuing with music theme? an avatar - a figure free-falling, sliding, wobbling, waving, crashing...I think actually it would be perfect (nightmare to program I\\\'m sure) but unlike audiosurf (what I\\\'ve likened to in the past) - there\\\'s nothing \\\'tangible\\\' to grab on to, or see the effect / causes of what you\\\'re doing...Out of all the updates, this has been my least favourite... I don\\\'t think it related to music vs machine, more ""try out new ideas"" - which is totally cool (love you guys for reading all of this) but ultimately for me, this game will succeed or fail on how well you match the beat / music to what is going on around you - forget storyline and all that jazz.. nail the essential mechanics and you\\\'re on to a winner - if it doesn\\\'t and it\\\'s all a bit \\\'meh\\\' and wobbly - it\\\'ll be no different to ""aaaaaaaaaah"" and will unfortunately fail... :(Good luck and can\\\'t wait to see the next version!! xD"
8,crash,#3,"Mar 23, 2013 @ 1:52pmÂ ","LEVEL 4-I played ""Falling Down"" by Muse.  The loading time was 35.69 seconds.-""Falling Down"" is a mostly calm and slow song.  Somehow, I began the level crashing headfirst into fhe very first block.  When I got into the level, later on, I discovered that the left mouse button was useful (twisting counter clockwise relative to the spiral).  I think that\\\'s a good level to let the player make use of that trick."
9,crash,#5,"Mar 23, 2013 @ 2:11pmÂ ","LEVEL 5-I played ""Cave"" by Muse.  The loading time was 39.27 seconds.-As this is the first unlockable level where you can control ""Fatness,"" ""Spread,"" and ""Salt,"" I decided to keep all the settings at 0 for standard measure (I may play ""Cave"" later with varying settings for comparison).-For this level, I made sure to take advantage of the turning feature.  It may have been my lack of experience with playing this game, but I found that turning significantly increases my likelihood of crashing into the shapes.-I like how the more quiet parts of the song make the level more disparate, but I must question why there are certain clusters of shapes so far from me for when the song resumes to normal."
10,crash,#6,"Mar 23, 2013 @ 2:31pmÂ ","LEVEL 6-I played ""Showbiz"" by Muse.  The loading time was 59.32 seconds (that\\\'s almost a minute\\\'s wait to play my favourite song!).-Like Level 5, I\\\'ve set Fatness, Spread, and Salt to 0 on my first run with ""Showbiz.""  Comparisons with the settings will be made later.-The obstacles are actually spaced out pretty well (perhaps ideally for all levels as the minimum gap); however, because the obstacles are really thin, it\\\'s difficult not to hit any of them.-I must say that the white visuals you get when you grind the walls have been very distracting; it might have been because I\\\'ve set the visuals to ""Fastest,"" but I found that the white strips that pass me really block my vision of the nearby area.  I will often crash against the obstacles because of this.-""Showbiz"" is a song that starts slow and quiet, but grows louder and faster as it goes on; the level doesn\\\'t really reflect that; if anything, the visuals are either consistent throughout the song or the fastest and loudest parts get more space instead of obstacles.  The level, therefore, feels antithetical to the song itself."
11,crash,#14,"May 20, 2013 @ 5:23pmÂ ","I\\\'m sorry that I do not have an analysis as complete as everything before this, but I would like to give some feedback that I think you will find useful.VISUALSIt\\\'s been a long time since I played Drop That Beat, but I must say that I really like the new UI; the green honeycomb design really works well in terms of aesthetic and with less interferance.I also like the addition of the little dot (or has it always been there?  It\\\'s been a while) at the center of the screen; it\\\'s nice to have a point of reference.And the white sparks I talked about when I played Level 6 for the first time are still there.  The white sparks are still distracting, especially when I\\\'m attempting to score major points; again, the white sparks can interfere with my sight, and thus I am more likely to crash into things.GAMEPLAYI think the multiplyer is a good system so far; and if you crash, you lose that multiplyer and all potential points.  I think there should be a greater risk, as in if you crash too many times, it\\\'s game over.  I think that\\\'s worth exploring.While I didn\\\'t keep track of the score when I played Falling Down (on the same level no less), I am glad to see that the hyperinflation is reduced.  Still, I think it would be a more fair score if you take off one or two decimal points.  Still, it\\\'s an improvement.I have just finished playing Cave (on the same level, LEVEL 4, all values set to 0 for standard measure), and I am glad that the objects are not as disparate as they used to be.MISCELLANIOUSVolume control is still missing... along with the Options menu.  But at least I can pick a song within the game rather than copy and paste the songs I want.If I have any more comments, I\\\'ll add them here in this thread."

13,crash,"Jun 6, 2013 @ 7:49pm",More random suggestions,"From what I\\\'ve played so far, a few things came to mind pretty quickly that would be wise to add to the game at some point:Let you manage through directories of music without putting it in the oflder everytime(It takes up space quite fast if you\\\'re someone who downloads a lot of music like me.Another thing would be to have actual recoil from collision with objects.As in, not pass through them while you crash, but rebound off trajectory slightly.Also, did you guys cound on adding textures to blocks that could interact with the song?For example, having parts that go with the song become more illuminated and move like the lines of a heart beat monitor whilst still keeping the looks of what the shape is?Also, for the UI while playing, I personally think it would be nicer to have all the different lines start on the edges of the screen and move out depending on how intense the track is.Another thing would be blocks that move around while you\\\'re close to them,whipping around haphazardly for example, or else having a block grow and have another block being made from in, like that one part in Cows & Cows & Cows where the cow\\\'s neck grows to multiply into mulpiple heads?Also, things that shoot at you at every beat?By the by, if others feel like it, they can post their own suggestions, even if suggestion threads have already been made."
14,crash,        ,"May 10, 2013 @ 1:52pmÂ ","MY FEEDBACK 10/05 - WAFFLES!!!Well, I wanted to give feedback before they got cold...Firstly, LOVING the new scoring system, much better than buzz / groove - shows exactly what you\\\'re getting and loving the counter at the bottom (and the fact it\\\'s that risk / reward, do you jump off and collect the score or keeping racking it up) - would be nice for a some kind of cash noise (kerching) if you pull it off or some kind of negative buzz sound if you don\\\'t...Loving the hexagonal look - very nice, red hexagons when you crash, great...Loving the timer at the top now and the multiplier\\\'s up to five (keep it going!) and love the almost instant drop / desaturation after just a couple of hits (makes it more effective / meaningful)Quickly in terms of levels...L1 - colour overload! for me, it almost seems too close to the front of the screen - so it saturates the blocks mid-distance - ruining the distance effect - it needs to be further away... I personally don\\\'t like it - if you\\\'re going to make it ""in your face"" as much as that (and I reckon this effect would be perfect for L4 - the orange level - as it\\\'s so sprawling / narrow - that you don\\\'t see much else apart from inside cylinders, etc. - so the full screen flash would work better) - then it needs to pulse with the music much closer / better - we\\\'re still quite a way off from that  (but another great idea)!I still think you\\\'ve got it almost spot on with L2 (blue cubes) - the equaliser shape, etc. is perfect and in perfect proportion (and still the most fun level for me) - and it feels the closest to representing the music than the others... love the way things break up or fly in your face just as you reach them - by far the most exciting level!I didn\\\'t mention L3 before (stonehenge) - not a fan to be honest, it\\\'s just too empty - BUT - I think it would be a perfect section (so distinctive) for a quiet section in a music track - if there\\\'s a lull, no beat, etc. stonehenge blends in - really noticeable shift and all that work is still utilised! Like the way the henges pulse to the beat - maybe more shapes / pulsing in other levels to really show off the music link...Going back to L4 - loving the pulsing shapes in the distance (swap colours on L1 for those!) - ramp them up, more pulsing traffic... the problem with L4 for me is to get any sense of music immersion - you have to be outside the structure to see everything pulse... (which renders the level really boring) inside it\\\'s SO busy there\\\'s nothing to visually link it to the music track (good level though, possibly needs a bit more variety in it though) I\\\'d like it to be a pure tunnel - with edges - so you can\\\'t just fly anywhere - almost like the stonehenge idea of playing within a circle - but a lot more claustrophobic...Have to say, loving this game though, it\\\'s like getting a free expansion pack every time you guys update - and watching this game morph and grow is actually just as much fun as playing it!KEEP UP THE AMAZING WORK!!! :)"

This update helps us *much* more accurately detect beats for EDM and bass-heavy songs.One last thing: weÂre playing with the idea of letting you rotate yourself within the world. Press the mouse buttons to rotate left or right. How does it feel? Do you think thatÂd be a fun addition for gameplay? WeÂve got a few ideas weÂre going to keep under our collective hats right now. Did you notice that Dave was wearing a hat in our video? He always does that.. whatÂs he hiding under there?As always, tell us what you love, what you hate, and what youÂre doing this weekend. (WeÂll be at PAX East!)=============================================================March 1st, 2013Update Name: The Fattest Baby is the CutestHey everyone!Some gritty details of our work:- Stunts! Nine of them! Build up a huge combo, but be careful to not risk it all!- A level select, and three different levels for you to play in. Tell us what you like about each of them, and which ones you like most.- Performance improvements to balance out the crazy colors that we\\\'ve been throwing into the game.- You can take screenshots now, just hit F12 at any time. They\\\'ll be in the ""Screenshots"" folder in the game directory.- A proximity sensor. A segmented circle shows up where nearby things are to you, and how close you\\\'re getting to them.- Caching for some of our level loading stuff, so you should be seeing faster load times.- Three new songs! (Two from Morgan Packard, and another one from Hybrid Mind Studios)The feedback from you guys has been absolutely awesome so far, development continues to move along. We decided to take a chunk of time and dedicate February to really refining where we want the gameplay to go. This build should show a great base for where we\\\'re going.Previously we had you collect two different types of pickups. One for Signal, which increases your multiplier and beautifies the level, and another simply for points. Some of you mentioned wanting to do more than that, so we took that feedback and folded it into a brand-new stunt system!It builds off of some gameplay reminiscient to Aaaaa! If you pass by an object quickly, you get a buzz. If you pass alongside an object for an extended amount of time, you get a groove. As you build combinations and perturbations of these movements, you\\\'ll be able to discover up to eight different stunts we\\\'ve thrown in, AS A START.We\\\'re pretty excited about this whole thing, we think it\\\'s going to open up a whole new way for you to re-experience and explore your music. Tell us what you think.Known things:- Unicode song names still doesn\\\'t work.=============================================================February 1st, 2013Update Name: Task MasterChangesIchiro says: Our goal was to bump the fun up one notch and get the music-to-level connection up one notch. (We ain\\\'t there yet, but we\\\'re closer!) We\\\'ve started looking at individual songs and considering how they should look in the game. For example, we wanted Enya\\\'s A Day Without Rain to feel open and free, like a toddler who\\\'s simultaneously discovered the twin concepts of nudity and running down the street. So, when the game hears a song that\\\'s low-energy, the playing field opens up all big-like, and the obstacles leave.We\\\'re also just now starting to make different songs feel different in other ways. We run what we call a mutator over a level on certain tracks, so if you try a handful of different ones, you should see some variation between them.Known Issues:- The game still chokes on files with unicode characters. YouÂll have to rename it in order to play it for now, sorry.- More excuses incoming!=============================================================January 25th, 2013Update Name: Nasty ButlerWe hope you guys had a great new year. We spent some time chewing on your feedback, drinking far too much eggnog, and stretching our legs with the tools that weÂve built so far. This update continues to focus on making gameplay more fun, and making visuals feel even more visceral.Changelog:- New Mechanics! Collecting signal truly plays into the visual feel of the game now, and affects the multiplier of our brand-spanking-new secondary point pickup. Max out your signal and grab as many points as you can. Point multiplier from 1x to 3x depending on your signal %. (Twist: Signal drains slowly during normal gameplay.)- The level constricts and expands depending on the feel of the song you\\\'re listening to.- Added mousewheel scrolling to the filebrowser- No less than 537 optimizations. The game should run beautifully and smoothly on your toaster.- Added a crosshair, and tweaked the movement and camera angle a good bit. (Protip: WeÂve added three different crosshairs. Press F1 to toggle between all of them. Tell us which one is your favorite.)Known Issues:- The game still chokes on files with unicode characters. YouÂll have to rename it in order to play it for now, sorry.- E-mail rshenoy@dejobaan.com with a convincing complaint about all the Reddit spam he\\\'s been putting out. The most convincing person will get an alpha key to Drunken Robot Pornography, because why not.- ThatÂs it, weÂre only allowed to have one bug in the game.=============================================================December 21st, 2012Update Name: Rabid WumpusThat\\\'s two updates in one month. We are not kidding around here. Our focus at the moment is SPEED. Does the game feel like it\\\'s more fun than the first build for its fastness?We\\\'ll make it more fun in other ways as well -- more mechanics, better controls. Maybe WASD or gamepad, as Wuggly says. But right now, think ""speed."" Thanks for reading.Changelog:- Fixed FileBrowser Bugs (see previous thread)- Speed Improvements for slower systems.- Signal Level is displayed on the screen UI during gameplay.- More visual feedback when you level your signal up.- Gameplay speed moves 3x faster.- Added two new sub pattern types (Doom Hoops and Death Elbows!)- Stopped signal pickups from moving.- Don\\\'t allow signal pickups outside of bass tube.- Slowed flower pieces movement speed and amount.- Increased amount of initial signal to pickup when game starts.- Reduced number of pieces in outside bass tube.- Reduced amount and size of debris field type patterns.- Reduced size of star field patterns.- Spicy Mountain Lion- Other misc balancing tweaks to the level to adjust for faster gameplay speed.=============================================================December 19th, 2012Update Name: Alex Is NudeLadies and gents, may I present you with the first playable Steam pre-release build in about 50 billion years.Details:- Lots of research on Procedural Content Generation (PCG).- We re-wrote the game from the ground up in Unity. It\\\'s now all in Unity + Python, making it moddable and wonderful.- There\\\'s a new music analysis engine called BeatBox, which Andy Eiche created. We\\\'re just beginning to make use of this.- The guys from fellow Boston indie studios Zapdot (Michael Carriere) and Hybrid Mind Studios (Dave Evans) are working with us full time now. Michael\\\'s focused on Unity, and Dave and I are focused on the PCG side of things.- In the past year and a half, we\\\'ve tested dozens of mechanics.What you\\\'re seeing is the very first Unity build we\\\'re releasing to the wild. Let us know what you think.NOTE: We\\\'re trying a few new things out in this build. Some will be awesome; some, we\\\'ll want to change.Let us know what you like and feel we could improve."
18,bug,Prism Lizard,"Jul 24, 2013 @ 3:26pmÂ ","I\\\'ve noticed two bugs:1. Scoring for proximity to objects now seems to be flat, rather than scaling up for how close you got without actually hitting it. Previously you could score 500-5000 by buzzing something with a maxed-out multiplier, now it\\\'s just a flat 500. This seems like a pretty big change to not mention if it was intended; it\\\'s cutting my scores by an average of two-thirds. 2. The song browser doesn\\\'t seem to work with folders with more than about 100 items in them. Sometimes it shows subfolders but not files in that directory; other times there\\\'s just the spinning icon with no sign it\\\'s doing anything at all."

I love the texture work.Now, I know this is just a WIP for the next build, but there are a few things that bothered me:The inertia of the movements. Maybe it is just me, but I find it almost impossible to play. There is so much inertia! If you press the key for an instant, you won\\\'t move; if you press it longer you are sent flying towards every building on the screen and you won\\\'t stop easily (hey, maybe the buildings should stop you?).(EDIT: OH, no wonder I find the movement so weird. You played with the mouse before)In the third level buildings will move towards you and you will have very little time to react, I remember, though I could be wrong, that once or twice a building moved into me as I was groving it. It is very frustrating.I think grooves should last longer. If I am groving one block and there is a short gap, the groove will go away.I got a buggy bug bug: http://steamcommunity.com/id/LeZim/screenshot/540722836626691588I got it twice, on different levels, but I didn\\\'t manage to figure out what conditions cause it.Keep up the great work guys!"

I\\\'d love to test your game and weed out any bugs, and I was SUPER excited to see the update and all the new levels, but playing with WASD now makes it a very unenjoyable experience."

Be careful.Added 3 new levels to the world map! Look for Central Sky, Central Sky Open, and Binaural Beats. Continued tweaking existing levels by adding collectibles and hackables.

29,bug,"Oct 19, 2013 @ 4:17am",New Review 3.0(?),"So, as ever, I wanted to give people (and maybe if they\\\'re reading - the developers) a quick insight into what I thought, as I\\\'ve been following this for a good few months now and returned to it after the latest update...Firstly, to avoid scouring through my ramblings - the obvious glitches / bugs...The multiplier. It\\\'s broken. If you crash into walls it goes up and if you keep on flying and not hitting anything, it goes down. Clearly it was programmed so that when you fly into \\\'collectibles\\\' it goes up... but it also works when you hit something!Second glitch? Collectibles. When you auto-generate a level with your music; 5.6, 3.2 open worlds in particular - there aren\\\'t any. So no multiplier. Unless you hit walls and then get some.Final gripe? ""return to desktop"" - argh, after each level you go back to main menu, have to log in again and then scroll to where you were.. not ideal!Oh and side point gripe - WASD - wasn\\\'t a problem except it didn\\\'t work! WS up and and down did - left/right I had to use mouse buttons, but I mapped everything via Pinnacle and used controller - much more fun that way!Okay..Onto the levels...Certainly the game has never looked better, 3.1 is amazing with the flying traffic, 5.0 looks lovely and there are some great ideas in 5.2. I do like the tunnel of 5.4 - but slightly repetitive and the colour of the tunnel, seems to jar with the neon stuff inside (it almost looks like an old empty picture frame..) but that might be just me..I see we\\\'ve gone from ""the world reacting to your music"" i.e. pulsing to the beat, colours changing, etc. to ""the world generated by your music"" - more like Space Invaders Infinity - which is kind of fine by me, but not really what was suggested when I got it, no biggie though, but there\\\'s now zero connection to what you\\\'re listening to and the blocks around you, which makes the levels feel a little lifeless to be honest. They\\\'re missing that crazy pulsing equaliser type effect.. but still very playable!5.0 looks nice but not much to do same with 5.6 - I assume the V.01 and V.2 are to progress some kind of story as there\\\'s literally nothing to do in those... I would have liked to play my music on all the levels - just for the variety (I swear if I have to listen to \\\'future shock\\\' one more time I may have to go on a retro city rampage) but the shame of that is 3.0 level is actually fun and there\\\'s more to do in that (on mute) than a lot of the other levels...And that\\\'s my biggest gripe I guess, it\\\'s never looked lovelier, it\\\'s never been slicker, the addition of collectibles is GREAT - love that for the multiplier idea (once fixed) - I like the fact it\\\'s harder to get grinds against walls, I like using a controller, it gives a wobbliness to controls so you can\\\'t be so exact, I like the new menu systems, there\\\'s a lot there I like (new aesthetics / blocks look lovely, the backgrounds are great) - it\\\'s all very nice.. and you know there\\\'s a ""but"" coming... this iteration really has the least amount of player interaction in what you can do WITHIN LEVELS - and that\\\'s the worrying thing... I auto-generated a good few levels with different songs and it generally ended up being a block of squares in the middle of the screen or the tunnel (oh yes, tunnel \\\'glitch\\\' is that you can\\\'t collect your score in the square tunnels until you fly out as it keeps adding to your score, no chance to actually collect points you\\\'ve earned - a bit odd)... so yes... great progress technically, but from a player\\\'s point of view, several steps back... and now no connection to music / level, I\\\'m not sure how this can be marketed... or it\\\'ll need to be marketed slightly differently...Will I stick with it? Of course! I want to see how it grows! Will I be getting Audiosurf 2 to see how levels link with music? I\\\'m afraid so... I didn\\\'t want to, 1,2,3 isn\\\'t quite giving me what it put on the can at the start, but it\\\'s certainly a fun diversion... and well worth purchasing, as long as you understand what you\\\'re getting.."

33,bug,"Jul 4, 2013 @ 12:42pm",Questions to Dev\\\'s,"Thought I\\\'d start this thread as a direct response to another thread containing legitimate concerns (that hitherto have not been addressed) being locked - while the original thread was rather casual & ligh-hearted, having it censored does remove all senses of humour regarding concerns raised. I\\\'d appreciate an answer to the following questions when possible;Why is this product - which was previously released - now in early access form? If the reason being is to update the exsisting title, why bother reverting to an early access state, as oppossed to just releasing the update when it is complete? I find it slightly insulting that this product is now marketed as in a beta state yet charges seemingly full-price for what amounts to an incomplete experience with an optional medium to report bugs. More importantly, your game is currently falsely advertising a feature that is not available; on your steam store page it clearly states this title comes with ""Steam Achievements"" (plural) when in-fact the games current state does not include this feature as-well as the content that supported it & as your representatives suggest may not ever be available unless there is sufficant public interest.This culminated in me re-acquiring ths files for this title specifically to attempt to obtain the achievement (as advertised) where I spend about 45 minutes playing this game & browsing various media in attempts to access the relevant (currently unavailable) content. Now I am seriously contemplating filing a ticket with Steam - that failing I may also consider lodging a complaint with the FTC or appropriate trade commission. My hopes would be that games could be more accurately represented & ideally should never display features that it does not have, also, where appropriate, perhaps a notice or disclaimer of sorts could be rendered for consumer benefit (I mean that\\\'s what\\\'s important here, right?) again in the hopes that consumers are better informed & in this case potentially avoid wasting time looking for something that isn\\\'t there. It\\\'s about the principal now. "

That is one of the reasons why I never bought the game even though I\\\'m a big fan of AaAaAa. I do emphatize with you and with the people that have been waiting all this time for the game. At least now there\\\'s more hope :)Still, I\\\'ve been following Ugly Baby since I first found out about it in 2011, so I can try to answer your questions:Originally posted by D r a g o n:Why is this product - which was previously released - now in early access form? If the reason being is to update the exsisting title, why bother reverting to an early access state, as oppossed to just releasing the update when it is complete? --> Ever since the game was made available for purchase, it was stated in the store page that what you were buying was a pre-release version of the game and that you would get the full game once it was completed. Source: http://web.archive.org/web/20121101174243/http://store.steampowered.com/app/15540--> Though Early Access did not exist then (when the game was made available for purchase,  more than 2 years ago), it was never marketed as a complete product. Given that, and once the game is still not finished, the decision to move the game to Early Access makes sense. It would not make sense to keep selling an alpha/beta game outside of Early Access now that this mode exists.--> The game has been completely remodelled in such a way that the previous build, which contained the content for the achievement, and that had been made available for download still in 2011, has been completely discontinued. The store page description is wrong when it comes to the achievement and it must be updated so that it will not be misleading to anybody anymore. It is unfortunate that you lost a lot of time trying to get it. Still, again, this is a game still in development, it should be expected that a lot of things are missing and you should lower your expectations in regards to how fun or complete the game actually is - if you cannot focus on giving the devs feedback, on reporting bugs or suggesting new features, uninstall it and wait more time (not so nice, I know, but you have no other option)."

55,feature,XorUnison,"Jul 17, 2014 @ 12:28pmÂ ","I unfortunately have to agree with the poster above. It once was pretty cool, but now... it\\\'s not even playable. I mean, the new things like the voicemail, and that little bit of weird story or whatchamacallit is pretty ok and it adds some flavor.But the whole signal thingy is totally breaking everything from beginning to end. It just makes me want to fly out of the fray, somewhere far outside so I can at least finish my 10 minutes tracks at all. Actually I\\\'d totally love to even play longer tracks, but the damn signal thingy is just making it impossible, and the game feels like a chore instead of being fun. I agree that you gutted the game so far, and I totally agree that taking a step back is the right thing to do here.I HATE being interrupted when I listen to music, and to have a game about music doing just that is as wrong trying to breathe vacuum or something. Just remove that feature, or make it optional if you really must.Also the array of auxiliary sounds is annoying and unnecessary, it could be easily fixed by just taking all those sounds out and replacing them with visual hints.For example... you have that targeting dot in the middle of the screen, right? Just put some colored dots around it which pulse, change shape or color or whatever whenever there\\\'s something going on, like you buzzing close to some object, or passing any objects.For buzzing you could have a dot which changes color, and for passed objects one that pulses and changes color according to the number of objects passed per second. If you use that color for passed objects per second the player also gets a direct measure of where the golden spots to fly through are, and you can even acces the information tight spots where you really need to focus.As for the visuals, they\\\'re not fancy, but them being fancy doesn\\\'t feel too important to me. A bit of variation will certainly help though. Some times the bright background has interfered with the visibilty of things directly in front of me though, that\\\'s a no-go.And as for the shapes of the levels... The different \\\'cities\\\' are a great idea, but so far they bring one curse along. They divide all the different possible level designs among many so called cities, making the individual cities relatively repetetive. Before you divide and specialize the cities you need to have enough variation to do so. Take a step back and throw them all back into one pot and see what comes to mind.And last but not least, this may sound somewhat harsh but I\\\'m just honestly stating my opinion, trying to give feedback. The game has some great ideas and I believe the potential for something great is still there. Credit where credit is due, it really was fun once and I know it can be again.Oh, and the last official news post that we can see in the library page, the one with the level creation,  will have it\\\'s anniversary tomorrow... And one year of no immediately visible news is not overly cool, you should throw this information and maybe something else in there, just so that there is a clear sign of life out there for everyone."

Randomization is a bit touchy at the moment, but it does it\\\'s best.  There are a few levels that have a set song for them currently, and there is little to no randomization to those.  (The devs are re-working the randomization algorithim to be better, and an update for that will be next.)3) There is no landing at the end of a song, it just ends (currently, I do not know if they have any plans for the future to change it).4)  The game throws you into the skydiving from the start, no flat space to jump off from.I hope I answered your questions to the best of my ability.

The idea is do a place, that changes and moves as the music does. Maybe can include some goals or something to get more playable experience to player.The game is awesome, keep go on!"

I\\\'d appreciate an answer to the following questions when possible;Why is this product - which was previously released - now in early access form? If the reason being is to update the exsisting title, why bother reverting to an early access state, as oppossed to just releasing the update when it is complete? I find it slightly insulting that this product is now marketed as in a beta state yet charges seemingly full-price for what amounts to an incomplete experience with an optional medium to report bugs. More importantly, your game is currently falsely advertising a feature that is not available; on your steam store page it clearly states this title comes with ""Steam Achievements"" (plural) when in-fact the games current state does not include this feature as-well as the content that supported it & as your representatives suggest may not ever be available unless there is sufficant public interest.This culminated in me re-acquiring ths files for this title specifically to attempt to obtain the achievement (as advertised) where I spend about 45 minutes playing this game & browsing various media in attempts to access the relevant (currently unavailable) content. Now I am seriously contemplating filing a ticket with Steam - that failing I may also consider lodging a complaint with the FTC or appropriate trade commission. My hopes would be that games could be more accurately represented & ideally should never display features that it does not have, also, where appropriate, perhaps a notice or disclaimer of sorts could be rendered for consumer benefit (I mean that\\\'s what\\\'s important here, right?) again in the hopes that consumers are better informed & in this case potentially avoid wasting time looking for something that isn\\\'t there.

At least now there\\\'s more hope :)Still, I\\\'ve been following Ugly Baby since I first found out about it in 2011, so I can try to answer your questions:Originally posted by D r a g o n:Why is this product - which was previously released - now in early access form? If the reason being is to update the exsisting title, why bother reverting to an early access state, as oppossed to just releasing the update when it is complete? --> Ever since the game was made available for purchase, it was stated in the store page that what you were buying was a pre-release version of the game and that you would get the full game once it was completed. Source: http://web.archive.org/web/20121101174243/http://store.steampowered.com/app/15540--> Though Early Access did not exist then (when the game was made available for purchase,  more than 2 years ago), it was never marketed as a complete product. Given that, and once the game is still not finished, the decision to move the game to Early Access makes sense. It would not make sense to keep selling an alpha/beta game outside of Early Access now that this mode exists.--> The game has been completely remodelled in such a way that the previous build, which contained the content for the achievement, and that had been made available for download still in 2011, has been completely discontinued. The store page description is wrong when it comes to the achievement and it must be updated so that it will not be misleading to anybody anymore. It is unfortunate that you lost a lot of time trying to get it. Still, again, this is a game still in development, it should be expected that a lot of things are missing and you should lower your expectations in regards to how fun or complete the game actually is - if you cannot focus on giving the devs feedback, on reporting bugs or suggesting new features, uninstall it and wait more time (not so nice, I know, but you have no other option)."

It may have been my lack of experience with playing this game, but I found that turning significantly increases my likelihood of crashing into the shapes.-I like how the more quiet parts of the song make the level more disparate, but I must question why there are certain clusters of shapes so far from me for when the song resumes to normal."

Points by themselves are almost meaningless, but if I can see what the highest possible score is, or at least something close to the highest score, then I have something to compare mine to and might be motivated to do better."
84,feature,"May 10, 2013 @ 4:52pm",Illegal Waffles Feedback,"Wow a new update so soon and so much new stuff *.* I think I need to split my feedback into  two parts on this one. One part for general feedback and one part for stuff regarding the individual levels. Gonna do that one later.General feedback:GUI: Sweet Mother of Backed Goods! The new GUI feels very nice, you see where something is happening, you see how much is happening, and with a bit of thinking, you can even see what is happening. Keep up the good work, MichaelGameplay: The needle is cool, but seems a bit shy right now, like she\\\'s unsure when exactly shes supposed to show herself. Maybe it\\\'s \\\'cause she\\\'s new here, so lets give her some time. Damaging the sensor fits in very well, especially with the new GUI. But at times you get hit once and the sensor is completely shot, I think it should be able to take a little bit more punishment before it breakes.Personally I think this has potential. I am imagining a game mode where the interface breaks only after taking a lot of damage, but if a cell or part of it breaks, it does so permanently and if everything breaks you simply fail. But that is just what I would do, it\\\'s (of course) up to you what you do.Visualizer: Hello~Now this is some good stuff, thank you very much Dave. It\\\'s a bit trippy, not that I mind, and a hunge improvement towards \\\'Blackness with objects\\\'. Finally something to add \\\'activity\\\' to the levels. I hope something like this is going to get added to the other levels. Now the only thing \\\'left\\\'(that I can think of right now) are more round or otherwise not cubic objects and a good emulation of speed, but more on that later.Note: When I load/decompress/emulate a song there comes a sort of clicking noise that I presume is supposed to announce \\\'Hey player, I am done loading the song, click now to play it!\\\', but the problem is that this sound is played a few seconds BEFORE the song is ready. The longer the emulation process, the longer the delay between sound and the song being ready. Could you guys look into that?Personal Needs:Unicode support, as always. A way to save and automatically load at least one Configuration setting. About Speed: Speed is an important thing. Some songs are fast, some are slow. But some change massively, and those feel kinda broken in this game. Why? Because there is only one falling speed per song. It doesn\\\'t change. That\\\'s fine as long as the song stays roughly the same. But what if the speed, the loudness, the intensity or all three change halfway through the song? Some parts will feel WAY to slow or to fast.I personally think the only way to make the player feel speed is speed. The new Level 1 got the visual part of change in speed down, and it is beautiful, but I am still falling at the same speed all the way through \\\'Chop Suey!\\\' and just feels wrong. I don\\\'t know how hard it is to do it can be done, Audiosurf proofs that, and I really hope it will be a feature someday...Hoping for even more updatesMelmothp.s. Do you guys have a twitter account for news on your games? If so I would like to follow you."

This could increase the game ""replayability"" too"
87,feature,"May 3, 2013 @ 7:48am",Feedback for the new update,"Yay, Update! I don\\\'t think it is as bad as I make it sound down here, but some things need to be addressed.Objective Feedback:Gameplay: Groove mechanic is fine, but buzzes don\\\'t transform into grovves when you rotate while falling down a large enough building. Also, are combos no longer displayed or are there no combos anymore?Input: Works. Nothing more to say.Levels: The new feature causes many songs to consist of just one section of a certain level, or if  the song contains massive changes in intensitiy, two section of a given level. Often this second section is just the fist section with one or two additional elements. Artwork: Looks great, especially the first one, but the third one (test 19) looks very out of place.Subjective Feedback:Gameplay: If the combos are gone, I will be a very sad panda.Input: fast enough to get those grooves, but still controllable, awesome.Levels: I want to cry. The new mechanic seems to cause the game to pick one section of a level and then use nothing but it. It should be purged from the code. I am sorry Dave, but it ruins my experience massively and isn\\\'t really working. Level 3 needs to be a lot more dense. Especially some fast&intense songs get emulated in a way that the elements are very far away from each other, making it difficult to get even close to 100%. Level 4 is my favorite level, nice to have some elements that are not cube-shaped. Some times the oval tubes/tunnels get completly blocked though, that\\\'s kinda annoying. Also, slow songs turn this level into alot of falling into empty blackness with a few \\\'gates\\\' strewn in 50 meters away from you, of course only until the song has ended and you get a few second of silence, since the currenty level 4 apparently interprets silence as \\\'pretty intense\\\'. In general most levels could use more variety and density. Artwork: Number 1 looks damn nice, and what is called \\\'test 19\\\' just doesn\\\'t fit in with the current game.p.s. Still waitng for that Unicode fix so that I can play stuff with japanese or other signs. And yes I am going to remind you of that every time you update till it is fixed."
