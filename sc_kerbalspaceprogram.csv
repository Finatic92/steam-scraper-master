4,crash,Sasquatch_Punter,"Jul 13, 2013 @ 12:46pm ","Yesterday I finished building the fuel lander that I\\\'m now using to resupply my expeditionary mun rover. Docked it with my orbital fuel depot 40km above the Mun, exchanged fuel, deorbited it and landed within 3km of my rover (terrible aim, I know), refilled the rover\\\'s tanks, flew back up and rendezvoused with the fuel depot again. Afterwards I launched my rover (using onboard thrusters) into a long-range flight towards a crater that I\\\'d been meaning to explore. Used up descent thrusters just before I crashed into the surface, broke all 8 wheels but nothing else. Sent a repair crew from Kerbin, landed them, and repaired the rover; strapped them into chairs on the rover, and went exploring. :)I managed to find that massive stone arch by the time I ended my session. All in about 3 hours."

If you add RCS JUST for the stability assist during launch, place the monoprop tanks/RCS thrusters where they can be ditched as you reach orbit.If you are launching with solid rockets as your main boosters around a liquid engine, add a bit more fuel and have the liquid engine firing at low throttle for the thrust vectoring during the SRB\\\'s burn.All rockets and launches are different but as a rule of thumb...Get to 150 m/s as fast as possible then a slow throttle up to 200 m/s at 10k.From 10k to 20k a slow throttle up to 350 m/s.From 20k to 30k a slow throttle up to 500 m/s.After 30k it\\\'s usually safe to floor it and go max throttle.As you leave the launch pad you will want to start your gravity turn.If you DIDN\\\'T rotate your control part in the VAB, then that means pressing the ""D"" key for a zero degree (Equatorial) orbit.For beginers I suggest a 5 degree turn per 1k meters of altitude until you get to 45 deg. angle.0k-1k 90 deg. (Straight up . Get to 150 m/s as fast as possible)1k-2k 85 deg.2k-3k 80 deg.3k-4k 75 deg.4k-5k 70 deg.5k-6k 65 deg.6k-7k 60 deg.7k-8k 55 deg.8k-9k 50 deg.9k-10k 45 deg. (200 m/s accelerating to 350 m/s)At 30k continue turning until the prograde marker is sitting on the horizon line of the nav ball.NOTE: most people will say that these speeds/altitudes are off, these numbers are just to get you started in the new version, as you gain experiance with the new versions adjust to your own playing style."

8,bug,"Nov 18, 2019 @ 11:38am",Known issues on AMD hardware,"There is currently a bug that causes the game to freeze when played on some machines that have AMD hardware. The team are looking into it, and a bug report has been filed here[bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com].The current workaround is to play the game with terrain shaders set to something less than maximum. This unfortunately means not being able to view the improved terrain made available in 1.8.x, however the game will at least work.If you have any AMD-related issues even after lowering the texture shader level, then please provide any relevant details as a post to the bug report linked above. Sorry for any inconvenience."

10,feature,"Mar 17, 2017 @ 5:15am", KSP Making History Expansion,"Link![forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com]Uomocapra, community managerImage![i.imgur.com]Hello everyone,Over the past months, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve undertaken a huge endeavor to bring Kerbal Space Program towards its next leap forward. KSP is by now a mature game with tons of content and an immense modding community, which has devised all kinds of tools and creative additions to the game, so making something new and exciting for our players was a challenge that we faced head-on.We wanted to do something that could enrich the Kerbal experience, offer value to players, bring exciting new content and allow more creativity - all while bringing countless more hours of enjoyment. And with the 1.2.2 release we had a game in an optimal state to tackle an idea that has been in discussion for a while.We are thrilled and proud to announce Kerbal Space Program: Making History Expansion. This content filled expansion to the base game will include Mission Builder and History Pack.Image![i.imgur.com]Mission Builder is an exciting new feature that puts the process of creating and editing missions in your hands. We wanted to give you the tools to get the sense of being part of a space program\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Mission Design Division by tailoring your own missions and narratives in a friendly and intuitive interface. Once created, you will be able to easily share your missions with the wider community.Link![imgur.com]But that is not all, Kerbal Space Program: Making History Expansion will include loads of additional content to enjoy. This includes History Pack, which are pre-made missions for you to play immediately. You will have the opportunity to re-live historical missions from humankind\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own space history, all with that unique Kerbal Space Program twist! The pack will include a new set of parts and a new astronaut suit for your brave heroes. Imagine walking in the boots of the astronauts who witnessed the majesty of outer space for the first time or landed on other celestial bodies as the first of their kind.Keeping up with Kerbal Space Program tradition, Kerbal Space Program: Making History Expansion will be highly customizable and moddable.Key Features:Simple interface: Using an intuitive drag and drop node interface, you can easily create new and exciting new missions for yourself or others to enjoy. Creators can also add constraints such as time, fuel and parts limits; as well as unexpected mission events.Recreating history: Included in Kerbal Space Program: Making History Expansion is the History Pack. Players will be able to experience the trials and tribulations of the early days of Space Exploration on missions inspired by real life historical events.New parts: Aside from mission creations tools, Kerbal Space Program: Making History Expansion will have additional parts such as new fuel tanks, adapters, decouplers, fairings and command pods\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 inspired by both American and Soviet space programs!Kerbal Personal Parachute: Your astronauts will now be safer in case of imminent disasters with all new personal parachutes. So next time Jeb is in trouble and all systems are failing, you can simply eject him and activate his parachute. Then, you just have to hope, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an atmosphere to slow him down...Challenge other players: A new addition to Kerbal Space Program: Making History Expansion will be the concept of scoring. At the end of a mission you will get a numerical score to compare with your friends and the community.Kerbal Space Program: Making History Expansion is still in development and will be released as a paid expansion. Pricing and availability details will be announced at a later date.It seems as though our announcement two weeks ago was met with some disappointment, but we were just holding onto the good stuff. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t wait to see what the community is going to be able to create with this new creative tool within Kerbal Space Program, now more than ever with an enriched and diverse community of people from all around the world, who can now enjoy KSP in their own language!Keep tuned to KSP Weekly to learn about the ongoing development and upcoming details.Happy launchings! -The KSP Development Team"
