0,crash,Now Available - Patterns Early Access,"Mar 20, 2013","Patterns Early Access is Now Available on Steam.Its your universe to shape. Patterns is an ever-expanding 3D space, where youll construct simple and complex structures as you harvest substances and discover new shapes that can be used to enhance your creativity.Patterns starts at a low level with simple, basic shapes and allows you to expand your universe as you add together other shapes to make more and more elaborate constructs. Build large scale structures that reach high into the sky or bridges that traverse wide chasms. Use your constructions to reach new areas and break out of your space to discover other worlds.Be careful! Each substance contains different physical properties that can cause your creations to tumble, crumble or crash down to the ground. Will your creations withstand the power of gravity?"
1,crash,"Jan 28, 2015 @ 7:21pm",only uses CPU,i have a GTX titain Z  and its a dual GPU but when i ran NV inspector ... i saw that patterns used only 20% of one GPU and left the other one untoutched :/ .... why would the game use the CPU if ... there is alot of physics goin on when i break something tied to a big thing :/  .... (The beanstalk map in the explore section) i snaped the beanstalk from the cloud it was on and had MASSAVE FRAME DROPS ( i thought the game crashed but when it cam back ... i got 2 FPS ... is there a way to fix it to where it uses 80% of my gpu and not my cpu ?

7,bug,Release Notes for Update .04a version 67263 8/22/2013,"Aug 22, 2013","Hello Patterns Fans!It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been awhile since our last update, but we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been busy fixing bugs and adding new features to Patterns. One of the new feature that we think you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll really enjoy is what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEscher Gravity.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Gravity will now no longer just pull towards the center of the planet. Now it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s based off what is below you - making a digital version of an Escher-esque painting a possibility for everyone!In addition to the new Escher Gravity, there are two new block features: Runestone signs and Lanterns! Lanterns can be made by using 4 silver tetrahedrons and one moonstone octahedron. Once built, you can turn lanterns off and on by hitting the moonstone with your beam. Detailed instructions can be found on our official wiki[patterns.gamepedia.com].Using square Runestone top tiles (the blocks that are bound to 1 on your keyboard by default), you can now leave signs for other players. Once placed, double click on the block to begin writing your message. You can scale text size by adding more blocks next to each other and experimenting!We continue to work on fixing bugs and adding new features to Patterns, and appreciate all of your feedback and support. Stay tuned for more updates!The Patterns TeamRelease Notes for Update .04a version 67263 August 22, 2013GravityUse gravity as a tool and check out the new possibilities! Can you build an Escher Staircase? Patterns gravity is now called ""Escher gravity"". Gravity no longer pulls to the center of the planet and instead is based on what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s below the player. When digging underground, down is defined by the direction one enters underground.LightingPlease check out our wiki[patterns.gamepedia.com] for detailed instructions. Patterns now uses fully dynamic lighting with light emanating from the character, lava and moonstone substances. The Lantern is a new formation which can be used to shed light on darker areas. To build it place 3 silver tetrahedrons, 1 moonstone octahedron in the center, and another silver tetrahedron on top.  Turn Lanterns on and off by hitting the moonstone shape with your beam.Runestone SignsWrite on Runestone top tiles to leave messages for other players in their worlds! To use, simply place a Runestone top tile on any square surface and double-click, then type, and hit enter. The font will shrink to fit on the cube so play around with multiple faces to write in larger Font Sizes.Camera Improved camera for digging and mining. Confined spaces will no longer be as troublesome. Transparency on the player avatar will make maneuvering through the world easier - no more blocked view!Multiplayer We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve started using a Peer to Peer implementation to allow easier connectivity to games. Password support for private game hosting. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a new game lobby for hosted multiplayer games in the main menu. This will allow players to find games easily.Bug Fixes A variety of multiplayer bug fixes are in this patch due to the new Peer to Peer implementation. Main menu UI fixes and flow improvements are included. Players list is no longer available in single player games.Known Issues Previously saved planets are not set up for Escher gravity. The Lanterns are unbreakable until they are turned into free patterns. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still an issue with memory consumption so save often and exit the game to free up memory especially when in larger worlds. The new lighting effects on substances can cause some framerate issues if there are a lot on screen. There is a known issue that causes instability in Patterns after playing for a while.  Please restart Patterns between levels for best results."

Not okay in 2013.Please either fully capture the mouse or (preferrably) don\\\'t minimize when the game loses focus.

11,bug,[UGUF] Merkules,"Apr 2, 2013 @ 11:08am ","- Nak can be jumped on like a trampoline. You have to time it right, but you will eventually get so high you can kill yourself (Nak can often save you, but if you fall the entire height of say, Hanging Gardens, you\\\'re gonna die no matter what you land on).  Angle matters too, you can go really far jumping on a hill made of Nak.-Anything you build should be thought of more like carving stone, get the basic shape first, then make details if you want your structures to look cool.- If you stand on a directional trigger bomb and blast it, you will keep your second jump.  This little trick can be used to climb Red Bluffs super fast, however the camera can\\\'t follow you at that speed (watch your shadow to know when to jump, going first person helps a lot).- Rockets cannot normally be ridden if they are standing straight up.  You can also affect the flight trajectory of the rockets by bumping into them or jumping on them after a launch (they even spiral out of control just like they should).- The so called unsinkable blocks are not really unsinkable.  Just blow a bomb off on it after all the other blocks are gone and it will go crumbling down (likely a bug).- While you can only have 5 bombs out at a time that are affected by triggers, you can have infinite of all other bombs.- The trigger rocket bomb is bugged, you can only build it on the spot.  If saved as a formation, it will simply explode after some time.- Tall ice pyramids can freeze the ground around them in a radius of about 6 tiles.- Hanging Gardens is buggy, I recommend backing up saves. I\\\'ve lost three files to corruption already.- On occasion, when you select a shape, the game\\\'s framerate will suddenly drop.  If this happens, deselect the shape and select it again."

Interested parties are welcome to contact us[lindenlab.com] with proposals."
17,feature,Patterns: The New Builder Experience,"May 8, 2014","The next time you boot up Patterns, you\\\'ll find a very different experience waiting. As we\\\'ve blogged about before, Patterns has undergone a total user interface (UI) overhaul. We\\\'re proud of the new menus, buttons and mouse cursors, but the changes go much deeper than the visuals we\\\'ve teased before. The changes in today\\\'s release are about empowering creativity with powerful and intuitive tools. We\\\'re excited to get this new building experience into your hands to see what it inspires!So what does this update include that makes creation so much more powerful? Quicker BuildingSome of the most powerful new functionality is tied to the right mouse button (RMB). In the past, clicking RMB on a pattern would open the ""construct edit mode"", breaking you out of the gameworld. The new edit mode allows for the same functionality plus much more, in a less jarring way. Click once to select a single shape. Keep clicking slowly to increase the size of your selection, or double click quickly to auto-select the full object. You can probably figure out how to move your selection, but now by holding down Shift you can also clone your selection without having to save it to your inventory. Or use delete/backspace to instantly remove your selection from the gameworld. You can even use the RMB to select the terrain in a world, something not possible before, to rapidly terraform a world to fit your needs. With these tricks you\\\'ll be creating epic worlds in a fraction of the time it took before.(To see these new tricks in action, be sure to watch the latest video teaser.)Easier SharingCreativity in isolation has its virtues, but it\\\'s when you share with others that things get really interesting. Every Patterns user has access to the same set of shapes and tools out of the box, but one of the biggest factors in creativity is community. Sometimes we don\\\'t know what we are capable of until someone else helps point the way with an inspiring build. And putting your own work out there to be seen can be a powerful motivator to push your own skills. All of us on the Patterns team are fans of (and sometimes contributors to) the thriving communities around Second Life, Minecraft, LEGO and other platforms for creativity.Patterns has always offered the ability to publish your works and download others\\\' creations from the Cosmos, but we\\\'re making it easier to highlight worlds with pictures and descriptions. Every time you save a world, Patterns generates a screenshot. From the Create menu you can add a text description. Best of all, we\\\'ve removed the limit to how many worlds you can publish! If you\\\'ve published a world in the past that you\\\'re proud of, now would be a good time to update your world and republish. New Worlds to Inspire YouNext time you go to create a new world, you\\\'ll see some options that weren\\\'t there before. Alongside old favorite starting points like the ""Genesis Cube"", we\\\'ve added a few options that offer a fresh twist on how you build. ""Flatland"" and ""Chromatic Cubeworld"" launch with a new materials pack with a vast range of colors instead of the organic substances you\\\'re used to. ""Uncharted Isles"" offers an archipelago of floating cube-based islands to explore and transform. ""The Steamworks"" is an interior space with a steampunk twist to get you started. With Scene Settings, you can mix and match Materials Packs as you see fit, and with the new RMB functionality mentioned before, you can quickly delete any elements you don\\\'t want. The planetoids you\\\'ve played before are still there in the cosmos under the Featured tab, alongside a few creations that our team came up with while this update was under way. Remember to publish your best creations and maybe you\\\'ll get featured next!Foundation for a Dynamic FutureLastly, while there are a lot of changes to play with and master in the current release, we also made some necessary behind-the-scenes changes to prepare for the future. The Materials Editor, which you can play with right now, is just the first step in giving creators the power to control the settings and behavior of their worlds. We envision a future where both advanced creators working in collaboration and new players working alone will be able to add dynamic behaviors and gameplay to their worlds. We hope you\\\'ll enjoy these improvements to the Patterns building experience and look forward to seeing what new worlds you create and share to the Cosmos!"

You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be hearing more from us as we make progress on specific projects and features, but first, we wanted to share our vision for Patterns\\xe2\\x80\\x99 future with you.Imagine Patterns as a platform not just for building worlds with shapes, but also for creating interactive experiences you can share with others. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to put more creative power into your hands by allowing you to change the very things that make up Patterns itself! Lua scripting, substance editing tools, and direct access to tuning game systems are just some of the options that will be available. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll begin to roll out these new features over the next few weeks, and will keep you posted with our progress. The first release will be a powerful tool that will allow everyone to create substance packs and custom tune substances\\xe2\\x80\\x99 properties. If you want to make all the substances hurt the player or change the actual look of the substances themselves, you can! Getting tired of the current set of colors within our world? No problem - you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be able to change how every single substance looks, acts, and reacts.Another big feature we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re planning to roll out is a character creator. We appreciate the fondness that has grown around the current character, but a personal touch that only you can deliver is needed. Patterns is your universe to shape, and you should be able to create your very own personalized character to inhabit it!We also plan to provide a robust Lua scripting system for Patterns. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get access to script APIs that control game variables such as lighting values and the pull of gravity. Even more functionality will come from the ability to author moving platforms and control behavior in support of a variety of gameplay types.  We\\\'re eager to get these new tools into your hands and can\\\'t wait to see the things you\\\'ll create with them! These new features will give you even more creative power in Patterns. It\\\'s important for us to get these powerful new features right, and we appreciate your patience as we develop and roll them out. We\\\'ll keep you all posted as we make progress on these and other initiatives, so you can look forward to hearing from us more.Thank you for supporting Patterns. We\\\'re really excited about the future of the game, and we hope that you all are too!"
21,feature,Release Notes for Update .04a version 67263 8/22/2013,"Aug 22, 2013","Hello Patterns Fans!It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been awhile since our last update, but we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been busy fixing bugs and adding new features to Patterns. One of the new feature that we think you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll really enjoy is what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEscher Gravity.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Gravity will now no longer just pull towards the center of the planet. Now it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s based off what is below you - making a digital version of an Escher-esque painting a possibility for everyone!In addition to the new Escher Gravity, there are two new block features: Runestone signs and Lanterns! Lanterns can be made by using 4 silver tetrahedrons and one moonstone octahedron. Once built, you can turn lanterns off and on by hitting the moonstone with your beam. Detailed instructions can be found on our official wiki[patterns.gamepedia.com].Using square Runestone top tiles (the blocks that are bound to 1 on your keyboard by default), you can now leave signs for other players. Once placed, double click on the block to begin writing your message. You can scale text size by adding more blocks next to each other and experimenting!We continue to work on fixing bugs and adding new features to Patterns, and appreciate all of your feedback and support. Stay tuned for more updates!The Patterns TeamRelease Notes for Update .04a version 67263 August 22, 2013GravityUse gravity as a tool and check out the new possibilities! Can you build an Escher Staircase? Patterns gravity is now called ""Escher gravity"". Gravity no longer pulls to the center of the planet and instead is based on what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s below the player. When digging underground, down is defined by the direction one enters underground.LightingPlease check out our wiki[patterns.gamepedia.com] for detailed instructions. Patterns now uses fully dynamic lighting with light emanating from the character, lava and moonstone substances. The Lantern is a new formation which can be used to shed light on darker areas. To build it place 3 silver tetrahedrons, 1 moonstone octahedron in the center, and another silver tetrahedron on top.  Turn Lanterns on and off by hitting the moonstone shape with your beam.Runestone SignsWrite on Runestone top tiles to leave messages for other players in their worlds! To use, simply place a Runestone top tile on any square surface and double-click, then type, and hit enter. The font will shrink to fit on the cube so play around with multiple faces to write in larger Font Sizes.Camera Improved camera for digging and mining. Confined spaces will no longer be as troublesome. Transparency on the player avatar will make maneuvering through the world easier - no more blocked view!Multiplayer We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve started using a Peer to Peer implementation to allow easier connectivity to games. Password support for private game hosting. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a new game lobby for hosted multiplayer games in the main menu. This will allow players to find games easily.Bug Fixes A variety of multiplayer bug fixes are in this patch due to the new Peer to Peer implementation. Main menu UI fixes and flow improvements are included. Players list is no longer available in single player games.Known Issues Previously saved planets are not set up for Escher gravity. The Lanterns are unbreakable until they are turned into free patterns. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still an issue with memory consumption so save often and exit the game to free up memory especially when in larger worlds. The new lighting effects on substances can cause some framerate issues if there are a lot on screen. There is a known issue that causes instability in Patterns after playing for a while.  Please restart Patterns between levels for best results."

You get used to biting the pillow. The building, and the excellent groups you can become involved in are really the only reason I have stayed other than simple nostalgia. Yes, but has Linden ever gone back and removed already working features from Second Life months after they were introduced?  This ""game"" (you can\\\'t even call it that with the current build) isn\\\'t even fun to build in anymore, as it\\\'s literally Minecraft\\\'s creative mode with more shapes, and less actual gameplay to compliment the building."
23,feature,#12,"Oct 22, 2014 @ 6:21pm ",True. They were always fair about that much. It is a bit of a mystery why they would pare the game down instead of just leaving it alone as long as those features worked and caused no detriment to the rest of the game. Just good luck gettting any sort of answer. I do not know who runs the show since Phillip left.
