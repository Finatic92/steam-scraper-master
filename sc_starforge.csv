0,crash,"Week @ Code}{atch -- ""Beta Release v0.8""","Jul 11, 2014","Week @ Code}{atch -- ""Beta Edition v0.8""Howdy, We\\\'ve got the latest major update coming to you all live in time for the weekend! In this update, we give you all the much sought after smelter and refinery! Yes, now you don\\\'t have to hunt for your ingots (though that\\\'s still an occurance)! This is pretty fantastic news, as it also allows one to combine basic ores into advanced ores to be later smelted into the higher tier ingots required for the best equipment.  Check out the Refinery here:The refinery helps players craft the more advanced ore in the game that cannot be mined, but must be combined in order to be obtained.  And next up, we have the Smelter:This is the actual item used to convert ores into ingotsWe\\\'re also bringing you more in the way of base defense, with the introduction of the inexpensive and fast-acting minigun turret, allowing players to secure rare deposits for their faction quickly.  We\\\'re also introducing the much more powerful, elevated laser turret in order to create the feeling of a well-entrenched position.The Minigun TurretThe minigun turret standing sentry at an outpostAnd here we have the Laser Tower:The Laser Tower fending off an attack on a mountainside.With all these new defenses, you\\\'re probably wondering two things ""How do I power them all?"" and conversely ""How do I shut them down in a confrontation?"" To answer the first question, we\\\'ve added a new high-end power generator known as the Fusion Generator.  It\\\'s radius is quite massive, and has the capability of powering several objects far away from it.  And secondly, we\\\'ve equipped players with a brand new grenade type, known as the EMP grenade.  The EMP grenade specializes in shutting down turrets and other powered objects.  Check out this look at the Fusion Generator:As was previewed on our facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/StarForgeGame?ref=hl) we\\\'re introducing a new monster into the game! A custom creation of our own called the Jelly Puff! This species is reminiscent of spiders back on Earth, but with the ability to float like a jelly, and puff up and explode like a puffer fish.  They\\\'re pretty deadly in close-quarters, so be careful when wandering about the crashed ships.  They seem to be attracted to the radiation, so the stronger the emissions, the more likely you\\\'ll run into one of these guys.  An imposing close-up of the Jelly Puff:Note: Not nearly as friendly as its name would implyWe\\\'ve also spent a considerable amount of effort on fixing up the framerate issues related to creature spawning.  There should also be dramatically less creatures and NPCs spawning, along with increased spawn timers as well, aiding the fix. We\\\'ve also tidied up vehicle related issues as well, and made improvements to cave and tunnel generation.  Two more front-end changes that we\\\'ve added to the game include a new weapon (omigosh!) and adding functionality to the paint-gun.  Players are now able to paint themselves and each other, including their armor sets with the paintgun. There also is a hue-slider within the in-game settings menu, where one can dynamically change their hue.  The new weapon we\\\'ve got is the double-barrelled shotgun! The players can now fire two intense rounds of buckshot fury into the faces of their greatest nemesis before reloading this beast.  Righteous Battlecry Optional (And Recommended!)We\\\'re really excited to release this update, as we feel it ties up 0.7.5 quite nicely, and brings the progression of the development into an excellent launchpad for things to come.Thanks so much for supporting us this far, I hope you guys enjoy playing the new update! From everyone here at Code}{atch, have a good weekend!  Sincerely,--Will  PATCHNOTES:- Fixed an issue where too many enemies spawned in   multiplayer games and negatively affected performance- Reduced the total number of enemy and NPC spawns   dramatically and increased the time between spawns- The dual barrelled shotgun is now available- The EMP grenade is now available- The Fusion Power Generator is now available- The Jelly Puff is now populating the crashed ship- The Minigun Turret and Laser Tower are now available- The Smelter and Refinery are now available to craft ingots- There is a chance the mid section of the ship will be   discoverable instead of the back end- A variety of vehicle related issues have been addressed- Made improvements to cave and tunnel spawning- Players are now able to paint each other with the paint gun- Voice Chat now enabled in-game, allowing players to talk to anyone within a 75 meter radius.  Push \\\'V\\\' to enable.   ***DISCLAIMER***PREVIOUS SAVE GAMES WILL NO LONGER FUNCTION WITH THIS UPDATE- See more at: http://starforge.typepad.com/starforge/2014/07/week-codeatch-beta-edition-v08-.html#sthash.DKxcnaTQ.dpuf"
1,crash,July Community Update,Aug 4,"Hi all. As with previous posts, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll start by recapping a few things going on with the continued support for the first Kenshi. For this blog\\xe2\\x80\\x99s special section, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re catching up with some of the team at Lo-fi to find out what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s keeping them sane in isolation before finally getting to development news on Kenshi 2.Experiment recursion.In the past month we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve once again been making use of the experimental branch, most notably around an issue users reported with saved games following the latest windows update. Many players had stated they were unable to save, load, or experienced crashing when they tried. In Kenshi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s latest v1.0.50 update saves default to the Windows user directory, fixing any potential issues linked to system permissions. Please keep in mind that if you wish to edit a saved game the new location to check is C:\\\\Users\\\\<YourUsername>\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\kenshi\\\\save. Defined interpretation.Hinted above, after consulting with the forum mods we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve made some overdue changes to bug reporting flow \\xe2\\x80\\x93 namely better collating more widely popular bugs, cleaning up a number of older topics, and providing a more visible response to new ones. This will likely mean pushing for a stricter adherence to the bug reporting format as I work to ensure they can be reproduced and turn them into meaningful notes to the programming team to progress. The end goal here is to keep fixing issues for in Kenshi 1 in a more transparent way, giving users more feedback on if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s feasibly possible to fix and where we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re at with their reports. For a more worded explanation of the changes check out the pinned topic here.Hey, Fans!In past blog posts we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve mentioned hiring a number of new team members to expand the studio for Kenshi 2. Over the next few updates, since we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re focussed on an important Kenshi 2 subproject (details further down) I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m taking the opportunity to catch up with different team members and share a little bit of who they are, what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re up to outside of the studio, and how they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing working from home.Guy \\xe2\\x80\\x98Warls\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Warley \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Concept ArtistI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m Guy, a concept designer with a background in graphic design, illustration and advertising. I joined the team in November 2019 and have been working on concepts for the architecture, furniture, and characters that inhabit the world of Kenshi 2.Home setup:For my home setup I recently purchased a Wacom Cintiq Pro 24[www.wacom.com], replacing my Wacom Intous 3. After spending 12 years with the Intuos 3 (which is still going strong) it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a big upgrade. I initially thought it was going to take a lot of time to get used to the switch but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m already really enjoying it and using it every day. The Cintiq is connected to my MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015) which works pretty well running things like Photoshop.Thoughts on working on Kenshi from home:I am quite used to working at home and have got into a good routine over the years. I do miss working in the office though, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s much easier to talk through different areas of the project with everyone in the same room, much less typing!Life balance:I have been spending the lockdown back in my hometown near East Yorkshire by the coast. Running and walking are the main things keeping me going. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m also doing some yoga in the mornings, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m rubbish at it but enjoying it anyway.In my free time I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been working on several of my own illustrations, such as the album covers for three different electronic artists that I finished recently.Other freelance projects I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve worked on that people might recognise include art for mud-and-lasers RPG \\xe2\\x80\\x98Lancer\\xe2\\x80\\x99[www.guywarley.com] and a cover for the gritty future comic \\xe2\\x80\\x98The Hand Unseen\\xe2\\x80\\x99[www.guywarley.com]. Right now, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m working on some posters based on my favourite Studio Ghibli films which follow on from other personal projects like last year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Akira poster[www.guywarley.com]. Victor \\xe2\\x80\\x98Mr4Goosey\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Goossens \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Technical ArtistI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m Victor, or Mr4Goosey. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been doing indie-dev on my own projects for over half a decade, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve spent part of that doing it for a living. I got fed up of running my own business and decided to look for a full-time job in the industry, leading me to Lo-Fi. I wanted to combine my love for making pretty things with interests in logic and programming, which is why I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m now a technical artist.Home setup:I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m running a custom PC with a Ryzen 7 2700X and a GTX1080. For peripherals, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got a Decus mouse and a Razer Blackwidow (Green switches) both with lovely wrist-rests. Finally, for screens I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m running a 34\\xe2\\x80\\x9d LG Ultra-wide which I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m looking to replace with something less bulky and a 27\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AOC monitor on the side.Thoughts on working on Kenshi from home:Thanks to past projects I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m used to working from home, so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really not that special to me, ironically being in an office will take more getting used to. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nice to be in my own place and have access to my stuff, but when everything happens in the same room it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easy to lose sight of the boundaries between work and life. It can also be hard to get to know the team properly when we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve not properly met. All in all, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m looking forward to being in-office; working from home feels less efficient and enjoyable than being together with people, plus it gets lonely and boring.Life balance:I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve started another gamedev project in my spare time, though I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been trying to get away from my computer too. Out of my new interests the main one that helps is blacksmithing. Unfortunately, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a forge yet \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll probably have to wait until I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve moved to the UK, but as I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m mostly focussed on armouring, I can do quite a lot anyway. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a steep learning curve, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really cool to produce something like a piece of armour out of nothing.I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m also just getting into electronics and robotics. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been putting off for as long as I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been doing gamedev, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m hoping to get started on it properly now. First steps are reading up on basic electronics (I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be able to give you a definition of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cservo\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), because that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the main part I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m lacking. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m hoping I can get the hang of that then get properly stuck in!Lastly, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been doing more gamedev. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve recently started playing around with Phyronnaz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Voxel Plugin for UE4[github.com], and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m currently trying to make a small, relaxing game in which you build a low-poly eco dome with cute animals in it. Not sure exactly where it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be going, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m hoping to release it on Steam for a few bucks at some point in a similar vein to Islanders.Harrison \\xe2\\x80\\x98Boodals\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 ProgrammerI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m Harrison, or Boodals, the programmer who was hired back in November. Up until now I\\\'ve been working on remaking the GUIs from Kenshi 1 in Unreal Engine, but now that we\\\'ve hired Craig, I can shift my efforts onto less urgent tasks, such as code cleanliness and stability. I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go into too much detail, but I\\\'d call it more of a support role, making the other programming jobs easier and faster, and discouraging code which could be unstable.Home setup:Since we started working from home, I\\\'ve been using my own PC for most tasks. We do all have laptops to work on, but I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have the desk space to fit mine. Using my PC also allows me to test the GUIs I previously spoke about on a 4k screen to make sure everything functions correctly at higher resolutions.Thoughts on working on Kenshi from home:Working from home is pretty great, mainly due to lie-ins and easy access to snacks (ha-ha), but it does come with its downsides. Not being able to quickly speak to other developers or show each other what we\\\'re working on makes it harder to get stuff done. We\\\'re exploring several apps and programs to minimize this, but you can\\\'t beat being in the same room.Life balance:Outside of work, the lockdown really hasn\\\'t affected me too much, as I\\\'m one of the lucky ones who isn\\\'t bothered by being locked in. I moved house just before the lockdown started, so I\\\'ve been hanging out with my new housemates and their cat, whom I pay tribute to in the form of pets every time I pass through Her domain (stairs, hallway, kitchen\\xe2\\x80\\xa6)Declarative prologue. The team have been hugely busy this month working on a \\xe2\\x80\\x98vertical slice\\xe2\\x80\\x99 of Kenshi 2, which I have the pleasure of sharing snippets of today. For those unaware of the terminology, a vertical slice is a portion of near-finished quality game which then allows a studio to visualise some of what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re up to. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s traditionally distinct from a prototype in that the quality is much higher leaving less room for flexibility but for us we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re blurring that line a bit and using it primarily as a tangible design tool. Internally nicknamed \\xe2\\x80\\x98Concrete Neon\\xe2\\x80\\x99, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about having a space to test and iterate on some of Kenshi 2\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ideas by taking them away from a design document and experiencing how they might actually be played. Sharing some thoughts on our first major milestone, Chris compares Concrete Neon to founding Kenshi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Holy Nation and his hands on approach to game design: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnyone who played the [Kenshi 1 early access] map in it\\\'s earliest incarnation will remember that only a small area around the holy nation was active, the rest was greyed-out and you couldn\\\'t go there, because it wasn\\\'t finished.  This gives us a test bed to get everything working early on so we can play the game and experiment.  I\\\'m not a very formal designer, my technique is iterative because my \\xe2\\x80\\x98special skill\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is playing a game for a while and then going ""hunger needs to be 0.8x slower and strength needs to raise 1.12x faster instead of 1.08x"".  It\\\'s also better that way because I can approach the design as a player rather than as a game designer.  I don\\\'t like game designers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d---This month\\xe2\\x80\\x99s blog post was intended for last so ran a little late, but we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d love to hear your thoughts in the comments \\xe2\\x80\\x93 with so many players following different game development projects it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great place to reflect. As ever you can join us on Twitter and Facebook[www.facebook.com] where we still have an upcoming creator competition to announce once we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve worked out the prizes... If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like a none-Steam way to keep up with the studio, blogs are available on our website[lofigames.com] and via our mailing list[eepurl.com].Cheers,"

28,crash,"Aug 15, 2014 @ 5:12am",My latest gameplay session :),"I just had a great SP session where I raided a crash landed spaceship and had to fight against monsters inside its dark and oppressive corridors! 8-]I built a reinforced wooden blocks ramp to get to one of the open hatches up high in the back of the ship, then jumped in...I used my Combat Rifle to kill some of the monsters at the other end of the corridor.Then I neared the entry room with my trusty Shotgun and cleared it: I found other rooms and several storage crates with high-end Blueprints and materials inside.I was disappointed when I found out I could only loot part of the ship since one of the inner corridors was collapsed and full with debries. I\\\'ll have to try entering from the other side of the ship too in the future.One of the blueprints I found was the Graphene Drill (which is presently the best one in the game) and I checked if I had all the necessary materials to craft it. Obsidian was missing.I found an Obsidian mound before, problem is I forgot where it was, so I had to go around exploring and fighting again... Finally I found it and started mining with my current Drill (Titanium Drill) then I got back to my startup base and crafted several Graphene Ingots. After that I was ready and I could craft my new shiny Graphene Drill! :-]All this without any bugs or CTDs and such (just e few glitches with terrain as always).Did you play the latest 0.9 version?? If not, try it! :)"
29,crash,"Jun 27, 2014 @ 6:45am",Current State of \\\'Beta\\\',"Let me see if I have this straight.You start near a beacon. There is a ship that crashed near the beacon, and only one such ship on the map. The ship, and surrounding area, has a pile of resources and schematics. Most important resources come from killing one of the 4 total enemies in the game. Over and over. You build a forge and need to stand near it to craft certain things. Big items like laser defense or vehicles take hundreds of rare-drop ingots from the 4 monsters, or extreme luck with the boxes near/on your ship. Exploration is a waste of time.. as you will find yourself in basically ENDLESS stone+sand desert biomes with nothing at all of any interest out there. You are just as likely to find any ""rare"" harvestables like guardian, titanium, voltronic and obsidian ore at the near edge of a desert biome, and you are very likely to travel endlessly and see nothing but stone in these deserts if you try to go further. Don\\\'t forget, dying means losing all of your stuff and probably never finding your way back to where you died if anything was there to loot. Say goodbye to your upgraded drills and any of the rare ingots that you\\\'ve harvested from slugs along the way.If you build a base, likely near (but not too close due to a  building restriction) the beacon, since you\\\'ll be able to find it.. you can sit in there and I guess kill the few enemies that spawn at night. You can also just blow the crap out of anything with your shotgun pretty easily, and not even need to build a base.Is that about it right now, as far as what is in the game to do? I want to make sure I\\\'m not missing anything here."

31,crash,"Jul 11, 2015 @ 6:17am",Terrain generation and regular server crash and rollback.,"Hi, first off, the terrain generation has a lot of issue, it needs a rework, as when generation occurs multiple layers are loading, each of them having it\\\'s own collision mesh, and that\\\'s far from good for performances, and for the game\\\'s athmosphere.The main issue with it is that you can\\\'t even run and have the terrain loading fast enough for you to be able to run constantly.Now another BIG and even HUGE issue is the constant crashing, that has been here since a while, every 30mn server crash, possibly rollback, and sometimes, when not able to remember player position, it\\\'ll spawn you next to the center shrine. This is a big issue for players evolving in space. When you\\\'re in space with your copter there too, the last thing you want is to get TP to the shrine and have to build a new copter to get in space again.Now i must admit i am deeply disapointed, this constant crash bug has been here since MONTH and haden\\\'t been fixed, not even in the release, nor in the 2 bugfixes after the release. This is insane. Your company made a lot of monney with RoK, the least you could do is to use a bit of it to fix starforge. It\\\'s not a bad game, even though it\\\'s not what was promised. But the constant crash and terrain gen\\\' turn it into one."

Content and features are two different things. That is why I rarely say anything about content. Content is the medium which is used to experience features. Survival is not a feature but content in the game which allows you to use the features which are being worked in game now. Once dig is in everything will be in game to allow for a survival mode. Mobs, dig, build, resources, crafting are all the basic things you need really. If you need another example think about guns in a game. Guns are the feature but the ak 47 is part of the content that lets use experience that feature."

52,crash,"Dec 16, 2013 @ 2:05pm","The GSCs Offical Survival Server! [Team-Based PvP, 30 slots, whitelisted]","Server Lore-You are one of the many survivors who has touched down onto Atlas. After a bit of exploring, you soon discover a small outpost formed by another group of survivors known as the Atlas Trader\\\'s Union. The goal of the ATU is to form a solid, secure facility for fellow survivors to trade in. Business is currently booming, and many trading groups have been formed.All is not well, however. Seeing the opportunity to become powerful quick, many people have come to form pirate clans, ambushing traders while they return from salvaging weapons for trade. Soon, some pirate clans have grown large and powerful enough to build small bases of operation. They are known to be fast, ruthless, and unforgiving.To combat this growing threat, a couple of traders formed a group to fight the growing pirate menace. They call themselves the Galactic Star Coalition. Made up of ex-military, merchants, engineers, and scientists, they hope to clear Atlas of pirates for good.At the same time, on the other side of the planet, a small group of survivors band together to start constructing a fort, and while they don\\\'t face the threat of pirates, the land they colonize is known Leech territory...Server Mechanics and Concept-The main concept of the server is simple. Two factions (traders and pirates) each have valuables that they want, and they don\\\'t want the other faction to get their hands on it. We will now go over in depth, the objectives of these two factions.Traders- The goal for the traders side is to collect the best, coolest, and downright weirdest weapon of them all, then return it to ATU to get paid in Iron Ore/Oil, or to trade them for weapons other traders have found. Pirates- The goal for the pirates is to screw up the traders as much as they can. They have the same basic goal as traders, but instead of actively going out and find weapons, they wait for traders to pass through the mountains, where most of the weapons and any quality weapons spawn. Pirates cannot turn weapons in at ATU for Iron/Oil, but they can still trade them amongst themselves.The time of the server is always kept at noon (day/night cycle has been disabled). This is because when leeches attack at night, death ragdolls start to pile up and lag/crash the server.We also have a whitelist (which means you have to fill out an app, and have it accepted, before joining). Though this might be a pain, it helps with filtering out trolls and people who are not going to be here long.There are also events throughout the week. Every Wednesday night, at 4:00 P.M. PST, the server switches gears for a bit and starts up a Fort Defense game to get people in the server cooperating under a single flag, and to just have some fun. After Fort Defense is over, we will revert back to Survival.On Fridays, the GSC will do training inside the server. Anyone may join in if they so choose, but training will be specifically for GSC personal.On Saturdays, GSC will run an anti-pirate op. These operations are for GSC members only, and are conducted in a professional fashion. Anti-Pirate ops are mostly classified to the public. This does not mean that other people cannot get together and try to raid a pirate camp at any time, these are just stuff that our clan does to stay active.For more info and whitelist information, please visit http://www.forgeforums.com/viewtopic.php?f=41&t=6287"

65,bug,StarForge Release Version 1.0,"Sep 18, 2014","Release Trailer: http://youtu.be/AXVledJlEmIWe are proud to announce that we are releasing StarForge today! After many years of hard work, dreams and determination, we are releasing the 1.0 of StarForge. This would not have been possible without the help of the community, fans, and supporters of our game through its various phases over the years.Two and a half years ago, Will and Steve were working out of a basement part time on the game, and then the game exploded online, giving us the opportunity of a lifetime to finally make the game we\\\'ve always wanted to build. A year after that, we managed to increase to a team of 4 developers. And after the launch on Early Access, managed to build a small company which has been working to bring you the StarForge release today. This would not have been possible without the hard work and efforts of a tireless development team, and your continued support.We understand that at times we bit off a bit more than we could chew, and certain areas took quite some time to build and test. It goes without saying that this has been a vast learning experience for us all. We really appreciate everyone\\\'s patience and support during the development stretch. We are glad to have participated as one of the first few games to launch the Early Access section on Steam, and to learn and develop with the community over the past year and a half. We plan to exit Early Access within the next few days. We also plan to no longer sell the Founders Club upon, or shortly after release, depending on how quickly Steam can remove it. We only want the Founders Club to contain exclusive rewards for early supporters.We believe we have put in some super cool and innovative technology and gameplay, including an Infinite Procedural World, Voxel Digging, Real-Time Atmosphere, Procedural Asteroids, Tunnels, Caves, Mountains, Biomes, Physics Movement, Vehicles, Tons of Guns, Creatures, and Objects, and so much more! All of this works with both single player and multiplayer. It has been a labor of love, we are glad to have progressed this far, and we really enjoy playing the release version. We will continue to monitor the game, and plan to do another update in the future with bug fixes. Further updates will depend on future sales of the game.Over the past few months, while in Beta, we have fixed the majority of the critical and major bugs, and this release contains hundreds more bug fixes and many new features.- New Tile Sets:  Monolithum, Detrite (Founders Only), Interior hull (Founders Only)- New Vehicle : Space Copter- Water/Lava Plane Generation- Dedicated Server Performance- Procedural Asteroids- Atmosphere  Shaders and Cloud Improvements- New Doors : Monolithum, Titanium, Graphene- New Creature: Sand Sloth- Desert and Badlands Vegetation-  New Collectable Plants- Swimming- 19 Song Original Soundtrack Completed- Dynamic Loading Screen- Frame Rate Optimizations- More realistic Terrain and Biome Generation- Blocks Have Better Performance- Badges (Founders Club, IndieGoGo)- More Dedicated Server Console Commands and Config Options- Community can now host their own dedicated servers of Creative or Survival. Please visit this link which has the info you need on hosting your own dedicated server: http://starforge.gamepedia.com/Dedicated_Server- 200 + bug fixesWe\\\'ve also finished and implemented our IndieGoGo and Founders club rewards. IndieGoGo backers must link their account in-game in order to receive their digital perks; Steam purchasers  do not need to worry about this as all updates are channeled via Steam.. As for the Digital Rewards (wallpapers, art book, strategy guide, soundtrack), we will be providing a link to the download for these in the next month as we are still putting the finishing touches on them. We will release another blog post about that when they are done.The hard assets (T-Shirts, Posters) for IndieGoGo backers are also being developed. We have already reached out to everyone involved regarding these rewards. If you are an IndieGoGo backer or Founder on Steam and have questions or concerns about your name being listed, please email us at sworin(at)codehatch.com. We will periodically be adding in the new names as we receive them.Thanks again for all your support. We hope you enjoy playing the release!- The Code}{atch Team"
66,bug,"Week@Codehatch - World Spire, Doors, and Space Helicopter","Aug 29, 2014","We\\\'ve been working the last 2 weeks mainly on bugs and stability fixes. However, we\\\'ve managed to put in some features such as the World Spire, 3 Doors, 3 Garage Doors, and the Space Helicopter.Check it out below:http://starforge.typepad.com/starforge/2014/08/weekcodehatch-world-spire-doors-and-space-helicopter.htmlThank you for all your support!- The Code}{atch"
67,bug,"Update 0.9 now on Steam! Alien Forest, New Creatures, Radar Turret, Optimization, and more!","Aug 6, 2014","We\\\'ve been working hard on a new update the past few weeks. There are many new features, and many bug fixes in this update. We worked on stability and optimization as our main focus. Our MP Dedicated servers should also be much more stable now. And we\\\'ve buffed Digging to be much faster.- Please note that due to internal changes in our engine we had to once again reset the saves.Here is an list of the new features:- Loot vats. There are 3 loot vats now in the world, you will see a beam of light from them, this notifies the players of a loot delivery. However, loot is only delivered to these vats periodically, so its first come, first serve.- New Creatures, we\\\'ve put in the Beedle, the Belcher, and the Prowler. Beware of the prowler, they are very strong.- Alien Forest Biome, get lost in the new alien biome, it can be very foggy.- Harvestable plants, you can now harvest certain natural plants and resources from the ground by hitting ""E"" next to them.- Sonar Probe and Radar Turret, You can now equip yourself to have both mobile and static radar capabilities. This will help warn you of creatures and players in the nearby area.- Compass, find out where you are going. It will also show the placement of your protective spire on it to help you find your base.- New Big Chainsaw, cuts through meat and wood much faster.- New Beacon light- Repair Gun, repairs all your objects using utility ammo.Aside from the new features, as mentioned above, we have been working very hard on optimization and bug fixes. We hope to have stabilized the servers a great deal. We\\\'ve also done a full pass on all the shaders and graphics in our game and tweaked and tuned them for the different graphics settings, you should be able to run our game on many more computers now on the fastest settings then you could before.Please visit this guide we made for some tips on tweaking your graphics settings:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=296911104Hope everyone enjoys the latest release, and thank you for your continued support!- The Code}{atch Team"
68,bug,Week @ Code}{atch,"Jul 18, 2014","Hey guys,So this Week @ Code}{atch, things have been fairly relaxed, compared to the previous week.  We\\\'ve created some front-end changes in the game and have added a compass, harvestable plants, and a couple of creatures into the game.  The compass is featured at the bottom of the screen, and shows one the location of the world spire, enemies, npcs and other players.  It shifts around on the screen and now allows players to find their way to beacons, other players and orient themselves around landmarks such as the Spire. Next up, we\\\'ve got a mean new creature that moves fast, bites you fiercely and generally makes you hate life.  Introducing, the Prowler:It\\\'s pretty ferocious! It can run quite fast, it has hardy amounts of armor, and its only weakness is bullets.  Lot\\\'s of \\\'em.  So if you\\\'re under-prepared or early-on when you meet this guy, just run the other way.  Also, we\\\'ve added a new animal of prey, that moves quickly and effectively, and drops a slightly different configuration of loot.  It\\\'s an non-aggressive class NPC, and skitters across the ground rapidly on its two fore-legs.  It can be a challenge to catch up too, and possibly lead to some nasty predators.  The rest of the week has been spent fixing up bugs and tidying up the netcode.  We\\\'ve also changed some development methods around, in the hopes of being able to add features more robustly.  Thanks for reading, and I hope you all have a solid weekend! From everyone here at Code}{atch, thank you! -- Will "
69,bug,July Community Update,Aug 4,"Hi all. As with previous posts, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll start by recapping a few things going on with the continued support for the first Kenshi. For this blog\\xe2\\x80\\x99s special section, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re catching up with some of the team at Lo-fi to find out what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s keeping them sane in isolation before finally getting to development news on Kenshi 2.Experiment recursion.In the past month we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve once again been making use of the experimental branch, most notably around an issue users reported with saved games following the latest windows update. Many players had stated they were unable to save, load, or experienced crashing when they tried. In Kenshi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s latest v1.0.50 update saves default to the Windows user directory, fixing any potential issues linked to system permissions. Please keep in mind that if you wish to edit a saved game the new location to check is C:\\\\Users\\\\<YourUsername>\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\kenshi\\\\save. Defined interpretation.Hinted above, after consulting with the forum mods we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve made some overdue changes to bug reporting flow \\xe2\\x80\\x93 namely better collating more widely popular bugs, cleaning up a number of older topics, and providing a more visible response to new ones. This will likely mean pushing for a stricter adherence to the bug reporting format as I work to ensure they can be reproduced and turn them into meaningful notes to the programming team to progress. The end goal here is to keep fixing issues for in Kenshi 1 in a more transparent way, giving users more feedback on if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s feasibly possible to fix and where we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re at with their reports. For a more worded explanation of the changes check out the pinned topic here.Hey, Fans!In past blog posts we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve mentioned hiring a number of new team members to expand the studio for Kenshi 2. Over the next few updates, since we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re focussed on an important Kenshi 2 subproject (details further down) I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m taking the opportunity to catch up with different team members and share a little bit of who they are, what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re up to outside of the studio, and how they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing working from home.Guy \\xe2\\x80\\x98Warls\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Warley \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Concept ArtistI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m Guy, a concept designer with a background in graphic design, illustration and advertising. I joined the team in November 2019 and have been working on concepts for the architecture, furniture, and characters that inhabit the world of Kenshi 2.Home setup:For my home setup I recently purchased a Wacom Cintiq Pro 24[www.wacom.com], replacing my Wacom Intous 3. After spending 12 years with the Intuos 3 (which is still going strong) it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a big upgrade. I initially thought it was going to take a lot of time to get used to the switch but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m already really enjoying it and using it every day. The Cintiq is connected to my MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015) which works pretty well running things like Photoshop.Thoughts on working on Kenshi from home:I am quite used to working at home and have got into a good routine over the years. I do miss working in the office though, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s much easier to talk through different areas of the project with everyone in the same room, much less typing!Life balance:I have been spending the lockdown back in my hometown near East Yorkshire by the coast. Running and walking are the main things keeping me going. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m also doing some yoga in the mornings, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m rubbish at it but enjoying it anyway.In my free time I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been working on several of my own illustrations, such as the album covers for three different electronic artists that I finished recently.Other freelance projects I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve worked on that people might recognise include art for mud-and-lasers RPG \\xe2\\x80\\x98Lancer\\xe2\\x80\\x99[www.guywarley.com] and a cover for the gritty future comic \\xe2\\x80\\x98The Hand Unseen\\xe2\\x80\\x99[www.guywarley.com]. Right now, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m working on some posters based on my favourite Studio Ghibli films which follow on from other personal projects like last year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Akira poster[www.guywarley.com]. Victor \\xe2\\x80\\x98Mr4Goosey\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Goossens \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Technical ArtistI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m Victor, or Mr4Goosey. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been doing indie-dev on my own projects for over half a decade, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve spent part of that doing it for a living. I got fed up of running my own business and decided to look for a full-time job in the industry, leading me to Lo-Fi. I wanted to combine my love for making pretty things with interests in logic and programming, which is why I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m now a technical artist.Home setup:I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m running a custom PC with a Ryzen 7 2700X and a GTX1080. For peripherals, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got a Decus mouse and a Razer Blackwidow (Green switches) both with lovely wrist-rests. Finally, for screens I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m running a 34\\xe2\\x80\\x9d LG Ultra-wide which I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m looking to replace with something less bulky and a 27\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AOC monitor on the side.Thoughts on working on Kenshi from home:Thanks to past projects I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m used to working from home, so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really not that special to me, ironically being in an office will take more getting used to. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nice to be in my own place and have access to my stuff, but when everything happens in the same room it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easy to lose sight of the boundaries between work and life. It can also be hard to get to know the team properly when we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve not properly met. All in all, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m looking forward to being in-office; working from home feels less efficient and enjoyable than being together with people, plus it gets lonely and boring.Life balance:I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve started another gamedev project in my spare time, though I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been trying to get away from my computer too. Out of my new interests the main one that helps is blacksmithing. Unfortunately, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a forge yet \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll probably have to wait until I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve moved to the UK, but as I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m mostly focussed on armouring, I can do quite a lot anyway. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a steep learning curve, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really cool to produce something like a piece of armour out of nothing.I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m also just getting into electronics and robotics. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been putting off for as long as I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been doing gamedev, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m hoping to get started on it properly now. First steps are reading up on basic electronics (I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be able to give you a definition of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cservo\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), because that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the main part I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m lacking. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m hoping I can get the hang of that then get properly stuck in!Lastly, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been doing more gamedev. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve recently started playing around with Phyronnaz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Voxel Plugin for UE4[github.com], and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m currently trying to make a small, relaxing game in which you build a low-poly eco dome with cute animals in it. Not sure exactly where it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be going, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m hoping to release it on Steam for a few bucks at some point in a similar vein to Islanders.Harrison \\xe2\\x80\\x98Boodals\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 ProgrammerI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m Harrison, or Boodals, the programmer who was hired back in November. Up until now I\\\'ve been working on remaking the GUIs from Kenshi 1 in Unreal Engine, but now that we\\\'ve hired Craig, I can shift my efforts onto less urgent tasks, such as code cleanliness and stability. I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go into too much detail, but I\\\'d call it more of a support role, making the other programming jobs easier and faster, and discouraging code which could be unstable.Home setup:Since we started working from home, I\\\'ve been using my own PC for most tasks. We do all have laptops to work on, but I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have the desk space to fit mine. Using my PC also allows me to test the GUIs I previously spoke about on a 4k screen to make sure everything functions correctly at higher resolutions.Thoughts on working on Kenshi from home:Working from home is pretty great, mainly due to lie-ins and easy access to snacks (ha-ha), but it does come with its downsides. Not being able to quickly speak to other developers or show each other what we\\\'re working on makes it harder to get stuff done. We\\\'re exploring several apps and programs to minimize this, but you can\\\'t beat being in the same room.Life balance:Outside of work, the lockdown really hasn\\\'t affected me too much, as I\\\'m one of the lucky ones who isn\\\'t bothered by being locked in. I moved house just before the lockdown started, so I\\\'ve been hanging out with my new housemates and their cat, whom I pay tribute to in the form of pets every time I pass through Her domain (stairs, hallway, kitchen\\xe2\\x80\\xa6)Declarative prologue. The team have been hugely busy this month working on a \\xe2\\x80\\x98vertical slice\\xe2\\x80\\x99 of Kenshi 2, which I have the pleasure of sharing snippets of today. For those unaware of the terminology, a vertical slice is a portion of near-finished quality game which then allows a studio to visualise some of what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re up to. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s traditionally distinct from a prototype in that the quality is much higher leaving less room for flexibility but for us we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re blurring that line a bit and using it primarily as a tangible design tool. Internally nicknamed \\xe2\\x80\\x98Concrete Neon\\xe2\\x80\\x99, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about having a space to test and iterate on some of Kenshi 2\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ideas by taking them away from a design document and experiencing how they might actually be played. Sharing some thoughts on our first major milestone, Chris compares Concrete Neon to founding Kenshi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Holy Nation and his hands on approach to game design: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnyone who played the [Kenshi 1 early access] map in it\\\'s earliest incarnation will remember that only a small area around the holy nation was active, the rest was greyed-out and you couldn\\\'t go there, because it wasn\\\'t finished.  This gives us a test bed to get everything working early on so we can play the game and experiment.  I\\\'m not a very formal designer, my technique is iterative because my \\xe2\\x80\\x98special skill\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is playing a game for a while and then going ""hunger needs to be 0.8x slower and strength needs to raise 1.12x faster instead of 1.08x"".  It\\\'s also better that way because I can approach the design as a player rather than as a game designer.  I don\\\'t like game designers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d---This month\\xe2\\x80\\x99s blog post was intended for last so ran a little late, but we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d love to hear your thoughts in the comments \\xe2\\x80\\x93 with so many players following different game development projects it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great place to reflect. As ever you can join us on Twitter and Facebook[www.facebook.com] where we still have an upcoming creator competition to announce once we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve worked out the prizes... If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like a none-Steam way to keep up with the studio, blogs are available on our website[lofigames.com] and via our mailing list[eepurl.com].Cheers,"

92,bug,Bluefiremax,"Jun 27, 2014 @ 7:48pm ","To the Developers: Hello! I have been following the progression of your game since very close to the beginning, and I must say it has come an impressively long way. There are still bugs to be worked out, and features you guys are }{atching (Pun Intended) but whilst moving into Beta, the game has received a well deserved amount of attention.Following the development, particularly the artwork sketches, the 3D design is quite aesthetically pleasing. Unfortunately, It must be said that the textures and colors applied could use a revamp. If feeling so inclined, perhaps a re-working of the textures would be admired, but falling short of that, many of your admiring players would enjoy a function to allow coloring of weapons. This functionality (if I understand your technology posts correctly) should not be all that far-fetched or far off to implement. It would allow for personality in our weapons, and for a more individually aesthetically pleasing experience.Yours sincerely,Bluefiremax"
93,bug,"Aug 15, 2014 @ 5:12am",My latest gameplay session :),"I just had a great SP session where I raided a crash landed spaceship and had to fight against monsters inside its dark and oppressive corridors! 8-]I built a reinforced wooden blocks ramp to get to one of the open hatches up high in the back of the ship, then jumped in...I used my Combat Rifle to kill some of the monsters at the other end of the corridor.Then I neared the entry room with my trusty Shotgun and cleared it: I found other rooms and several storage crates with high-end Blueprints and materials inside.I was disappointed when I found out I could only loot part of the ship since one of the inner corridors was collapsed and full with debries. I\\\'ll have to try entering from the other side of the ship too in the future.One of the blueprints I found was the Graphene Drill (which is presently the best one in the game) and I checked if I had all the necessary materials to craft it. Obsidian was missing.I found an Obsidian mound before, problem is I forgot where it was, so I had to go around exploring and fighting again... Finally I found it and started mining with my current Drill (Titanium Drill) then I got back to my startup base and crafted several Graphene Ingots. After that I was ready and I could craft my new shiny Graphene Drill! :-]All this without any bugs or CTDs and such (just e few glitches with terrain as always).Did you play the latest 0.9 version?? If not, try it! :)"
94,bug,Eleazaros,"Aug 17, 2014 @ 4:57pm ","Had a lot of fun in a session.  Getting started is a pita but once you get rolling...Seed:  Dilligaf1The desert biome is a mountain.  So is the new forest biome.  Lots of new critters running around and such and the starting area is pretty much a crater with the surounding biome being all hilly mountains.  Wicked tough layout.It seems they reworked some of the ...  ""resource placement"" logic.  I found dark matter slate out in a stone type biome vs the desert.  Things like that and all those powders and such...Crafting\\\'s gotten a lot more serious and the caverns aren\\\'t anywhere near as bad as they used to be with sudden cliffs dropping vast distances.  That, IMO, is a very nice change.LIke you, no CTD\\\'s, performance was stable and I didn\\\'t hit any major glitches but I did spot a few bugs.The slopes are steep in this map and some things run through the air vs along the ground - especially noticable near the space wreck.  They can\\\'t hit you from in the air and if you kill them they kind of float off.Some others come running at you from lower down and run right into the hills - going underground, never to be seen again.Little stuff."
95,bug,#2,"Jun 29, 2014 @ 4:35pm ","That\\\'s cool. Just because it\\\'s a sandbox game doesn\\\'t mean that you shouldn\\\'t expect more than painting dirt/wood walls to make your house. Ther\\\'es a creative mode and a survival mode, and I\\\'m describing survival mode, where surviving doesn\\\'t really require much in the way of a base. Until smelting is in, your current progress is needlessly turned into a grind, whereas other content comes much easier. Why be able to use a graphene drill to suck up 300 iron ore in a minute, but still have to kill little slugs to find iron ingots in low quantities? The vehicles looked interesting, but again require absurd amounts of ingots. My desire to grind slugs for a buggy in the game\\\'s current state is pretty limited, given that my experience with exploring the map has been less than positive. It looks very repetative and empty. Additionally it is pockmarked with these massive tunnel? cave? systems that amount to the ""surface"" being a super-thin layer of magical floating terrain with hard-to-see gaps leading to your death or a very long slog trying to find your way back up if you survive. It feels more like an alpha to me, and I expect there are going to be a number of map wipes as so many needed changes and features are added.. which is not typically what I expect in a beta."

98,bug,"Jul 11, 2015 @ 6:17am",Terrain generation and regular server crash and rollback.,"Hi, first off, the terrain generation has a lot of issue, it needs a rework, as when generation occurs multiple layers are loading, each of them having it\\\'s own collision mesh, and that\\\'s far from good for performances, and for the game\\\'s athmosphere.The main issue with it is that you can\\\'t even run and have the terrain loading fast enough for you to be able to run constantly.Now another BIG and even HUGE issue is the constant crashing, that has been here since a while, every 30mn server crash, possibly rollback, and sometimes, when not able to remember player position, it\\\'ll spawn you next to the center shrine. This is a big issue for players evolving in space. When you\\\'re in space with your copter there too, the last thing you want is to get TP to the shrine and have to build a new copter to get in space again.Now i must admit i am deeply disapointed, this constant crash bug has been here since MONTH and haden\\\'t been fixed, not even in the release, nor in the 2 bugfixes after the release. This is insane. Your company made a lot of monney with RoK, the least you could do is to use a bit of it to fix starforge. It\\\'s not a bad game, even though it\\\'s not what was promised. But the constant crash and terrain gen\\\' turn it into one."

Content and features are two different things. That is why I rarely say anything about content. Content is the medium which is used to experience features. Survival is not a feature but content in the game which allows you to use the features which are being worked in game now. Once dig is in everything will be in game to allow for a survival mode.

(Or any bet at all, I doubt a cassino owner is going to take complains because someone lost money at their tables or machines.)What people need to understand is that Early Acess isn\\\'t diferent from giving money on a kickstarter, the diference is that from the moment you buy a early acess you have the chance to play the alpha version (or so) and give the devs feedback about it.That said, yeah there\\\'s a LOT of \\xe2\\x99\\xa5\\xe2\\x99\\xa5\\xe2\\x99\\xa5\\xe2\\x99\\xa5 on Steam, mostly from greenlight (were the users that voted on \\xe2\\x99\\xa5\\xe2\\x99\\xa5\\xe2\\x99\\xa5\\xe2\\x99\\xa5 are the ones to be blamed) and actually a bunch from Steam Direct (THOSE we can blame valve, oh \\xe2\\x99\\xa5\\xe2\\x99\\xa5\\xe2\\x99\\xa5\\xe2\\x99\\xa5 what the standart they did for chosing a lot of those \\xe2\\x99\\xa5\\xe2\\x99\\xa5\\xe2\\x99\\xa5\\xe2\\x99\\xa5\\xe2\\x99\\xa5\\xe2\\x99\\xa5 games?)And giving merit where is deserved, Valve/Steam actually is pretty customer friendly, even facing that they\\\'re still a business and need to make money to keep running, they give lower prices at countries were game prices would be way too expensive for most average games buy it, they do all kind of sales (major sales and week/flash ones) to make games avaible for a better price to everyone on every country, they actually have a refund system, something that not every online gaming store have (and yeah, that system was way better before, till it needed to be reworked because users were exploiting it, so the blame it\\\'s on users). and at the same time, they keep selling dead games under the early access label, products that are far beyond their expiration date,asset flips and more.i agree with just about everything you say but i would never call Valve customer friendly as long as they don\\\'t remove the thrash that gets sold on a daily basis.at the very least, they should remove all early access games that have not been updated in more than 2 years and there are quite a few of those out there.that label you mentioned first, implies ongoing development.selling a product under that label while it is not being developed probably comes very close to false advertising.For starforge, maybe it should be labeled as a failed product.then if people still want to take the risk, it\\\'s on them, now it looks completed but it really isn\\\'t and not everyone will take the time to read up on what they are buying.","Jul 10, 2018 @ 10:05am","I DO agree with you that Steam could, even should, have a better system to show if Early Acess tittles are active or just abandoned projects, even if just a specific page for early acess tittles showing update dates and some info of what each update was. (A lot of games both EA or not do that as news, but would be nice for both to have a specific page saying what a updade is changing. I find myself aways wondering what will be when I see Steam updating one of my games.)But I believe you need to rething if you believe that removing a Store page is as simple as ""Someone in valve go and decide to remove a page for any reason, go and do it, removed."", I\\\'m 100% sure that each company that get a game or software on steam have a contact with valve about it, that define what both the company and valve/steam can and cannot do.Of course valve can and do remove store pages or just the option to a game/software being sold in the page when there\\\'s a reason like false advertise or some kind of malicious intent that go against the contract, but, and I confess I\\\'m guessing here, I believe there\\\'s nothing in the early acess contracts about a minimium updates by time period, and so if a company just stop updating a EA game, there\\\'s no breach of contract.Actually I believe there\\\'s not even anything specific of when a game can go out of early acess, we seen some games just going out of early acess while stll buggy or incomplete, sometimes the devs just stamping ""done"" over it and leaving. Sadly (again) -I believe- the contract valve have don\\\'t allow anything so simple as removing a game from being sold or game store page ""just because"" it been abandoned. (At least not while not risking to breach contract themselves, and surely valve/steam don\\\'t wand to do dumb moves and have the annoyance of being sued by some random dev \\xe2\\x99\\xa5\\xe2\\x99\\xa5\\xe2\\x99\\xa5\\xe2\\x99\\xa5\\xe2\\x99\\xa5\\xe2\\x99\\xa5\\xe2\\x99\\xa5)Steam could DO some better ways to allow even us customers to decide better before getting a early acess or not, but ultimately it\\\'s up to us customers see and judge what is worth or not risking to buy while still in early acess, or just keep our distance and wait for a launch.And for people who don\\\'t take the time to read before investing money, a few bucks on a computer game ins\\\'t from far the bigger risk they\\\'re allowing themselves into. If someone buy crap because did not stop to check what\\\'s inside the box, they can\\\'t complain when opening the box there\\\'s crap inside.That\\\'s actually go for anything in the world, but when buying a game (double for EA tittles) aways check customer reviews, if unsure but tempted to buy, maybe give a peek on the discussion foruns or google about it (or about the dev).PS: On StarForge, it don\\\'t even have a Store page for some time now, and actually that\\\'s a bad thing, the Devs did it to try to hide under the rug their dirty past (The infinite negative reviews of SF) while selling new games. That\\\'s actually another reason while not aways is for the best a store page be just removed, the people who would actually do some reading but not go as far as check outside steam would just never heard that dev just abandoned another project before."

Right now you are adding things that will make the game look better. THE GAME DOESNT NEED TO LOOK BETTER! Stop adding pretty things and get to bug fixing and proformence! Im using a computer th price of a small car and Starforge runs like crap! also you need to update more often and keep adding on instead of replacing the features! I want to dig but I cant unless I revert back to a really early build! The problem is you are loosing the attension of gamers! They will play the game see its problems and leave telling everyone to leave with them! you need to make the game good before you can make it beautiful! start with making a good game!!!!
140,bug,Another Zombie,"May 2, 2014 @ 10:47pm ","@Markieer, this game is early access, they don\\\'t have to be adding content to make it 100%payable, the purpose of buying into a early access is too support the developers in a idea, and a investment for you down the road. What\\\'s the point of adding in loads of more features when the current ones aren\\\'t as good as they could be, and will only be harder to improve the more they add in. ITS EARLY ACCESS DONT EXPECT TOO HAVE 60FPS. If people are upset that they bought a EALY ACCESS GAME and it has bugs then they are stupid as hell and probably shouldn\\\'t be buying EARLY ACCESS GAMES in the first place."

Sure, its got bugs and problems, but the progress is consistent, updates that introduce bugs are patched within a few days and the game is returned to normal.StarForge was released without a substantial amount of game play features. It looks like the devs abandonded their ambitions to make the environment challenging, and is attempting to dump this into the ""PvP"" arena... which it is so absurdely not a PvP game, has no PvP principles short of just being able to kill each other."

165,feature,StarForge Release Version 1.0,"Sep 18, 2014","Release Trailer: http://youtu.be/AXVledJlEmIWe are proud to announce that we are releasing StarForge today! After many years of hard work, dreams and determination, we are releasing the 1.0 of StarForge. This would not have been possible without the help of the community, fans, and supporters of our game through its various phases over the years.Two and a half years ago, Will and Steve were working out of a basement part time on the game, and then the game exploded online, giving us the opportunity of a lifetime to finally make the game we\\\'ve always wanted to build. A year after that, we managed to increase to a team of 4 developers. And after the launch on Early Access, managed to build a small company which has been working to bring you the StarForge release today. This would not have been possible without the hard work and efforts of a tireless development team, and your continued support.We understand that at times we bit off a bit more than we could chew, and certain areas took quite some time to build and test. It goes without saying that this has been a vast learning experience for us all. We really appreciate everyone\\\'s patience and support during the development stretch. We are glad to have participated as one of the first few games to launch the Early Access section on Steam, and to learn and develop with the community over the past year and a half. We plan to exit Early Access within the next few days. We also plan to no longer sell the Founders Club upon, or shortly after release, depending on how quickly Steam can remove it. We only want the Founders Club to contain exclusive rewards for early supporters.We believe we have put in some super cool and innovative technology and gameplay, including an Infinite Procedural World, Voxel Digging, Real-Time Atmosphere, Procedural Asteroids, Tunnels, Caves, Mountains, Biomes, Physics Movement, Vehicles, Tons of Guns, Creatures, and Objects, and so much more! All of this works with both single player and multiplayer. It has been a labor of love, we are glad to have progressed this far, and we really enjoy playing the release version. We will continue to monitor the game, and plan to do another update in the future with bug fixes. Further updates will depend on future sales of the game.Over the past few months, while in Beta, we have fixed the majority of the critical and major bugs, and this release contains hundreds more bug fixes and many new features.- New Tile Sets:  Monolithum, Detrite (Founders Only), Interior hull (Founders Only)- New Vehicle : Space Copter- Water/Lava Plane Generation- Dedicated Server Performance- Procedural Asteroids- Atmosphere  Shaders and Cloud Improvements- New Doors : Monolithum, Titanium, Graphene- New Creature: Sand Sloth- Desert and Badlands Vegetation-  New Collectable Plants- Swimming- 19 Song Original Soundtrack Completed- Dynamic Loading Screen- Frame Rate Optimizations- More realistic Terrain and Biome Generation- Blocks Have Better Performance- Badges (Founders Club, IndieGoGo)- More Dedicated Server Console Commands and Config Options- Community can now host their own dedicated servers of Creative or Survival. Please visit this link which has the info you need on hosting your own dedicated server: http://starforge.gamepedia.com/Dedicated_Server- 200 + bug fixesWe\\\'ve also finished and implemented our IndieGoGo and Founders club rewards. IndieGoGo backers must link their account in-game in order to receive their digital perks; Steam purchasers  do not need to worry about this as all updates are channeled via Steam.. As for the Digital Rewards (wallpapers, art book, strategy guide, soundtrack), we will be providing a link to the download for these in the next month as we are still putting the finishing touches on them. We will release another blog post about that when they are done.The hard assets (T-Shirts, Posters) for IndieGoGo backers are also being developed. We have already reached out to everyone involved regarding these rewards. If you are an IndieGoGo backer or Founder on Steam and have questions or concerns about your name being listed, please email us at sworin(at)codehatch.com. We will periodically be adding in the new names as we receive them.Thanks again for all your support. We hope you enjoy playing the release!- The Code}{atch Team"

There are many new features, and many bug fixes in this update. We worked on stability and optimization as our main focus. Our MP Dedicated servers should also be much more stable now. And we\\\'ve buffed Digging to be much faster.- Please note that due to internal changes in our engine we had to once again reset the saves.Here is an list of the new features:- Loot vats. There are 3 loot vats now in the world, you will see a beam of light from them, this notifies the players of a loot delivery. However, loot is only delivered to these vats periodically, so its first come, first serve.- New Creatures, we\\\'ve put in the Beedle, the Belcher, and the Prowler. Beware of the prowler, they are very strong.- Alien Forest Biome, get lost in the new alien biome, it can be very foggy.- Harvestable plants, you can now harvest certain natural plants and resources from the ground by hitting ""E"" next to them.- Sonar Probe and Radar Turret, You can now equip yourself to have both mobile and static radar capabilities. This will help warn you of creatures and players in the nearby area.- Compass, find out where you are going. It will also show the placement of your protective spire on it to help you find your base.- New Big Chainsaw, cuts through meat and wood much faster.- New Beacon light- Repair Gun, repairs all your objects using utility ammo.Aside from the new features, as mentioned above, we have been working very hard on optimization and bug fixes. We hope to have stabilized the servers a great deal. We\\\'ve also done a full pass on all the shaders and graphics in our game and tweaked and tuned them for the different graphics settings, you should be able to run our game on many more computers now on the fastest settings then you could before.Please visit this guide we made for some tips on tweaking your graphics settings:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=296911104Hope everyone enjoys the latest release, and thank you for your continued support!- The Code}{atch Team"
168,feature,Week @ Code}{atch,"Jul 18, 2014","Hey guys,So this Week @ Code}{atch, things have been fairly relaxed, compared to the previous week.  We\\\'ve created some front-end changes in the game and have added a compass, harvestable plants, and a couple of creatures into the game.  The compass is featured at the bottom of the screen, and shows one the location of the world spire, enemies, npcs and other players.  It shifts around on the screen and now allows players to find their way to beacons, other players and orient themselves around landmarks such as the Spire. Next up, we\\\'ve got a mean new creature that moves fast, bites you fiercely and generally makes you hate life.  Introducing, the Prowler:It\\\'s pretty ferocious! It can run quite fast, it has hardy amounts of armor, and its only weakness is bullets.  Lot\\\'s of \\\'em.  So if you\\\'re under-prepared or early-on when you meet this guy, just run the other way.  Also, we\\\'ve added a new animal of prey, that moves quickly and effectively, and drops a slightly different configuration of loot.  It\\\'s an non-aggressive class NPC, and skitters across the ground rapidly on its two fore-legs.  It can be a challenge to catch up too, and possibly lead to some nasty predators.  The rest of the week has been spent fixing up bugs and tidying up the netcode.  We\\\'ve also changed some development methods around, in the hopes of being able to add features more robustly.  Thanks for reading, and I hope you all have a solid weekend! From everyone here at Code}{atch, thank you! -- Will "

176,feature,Bluefiremax,"Jun 27, 2014 @ 7:48pm ","To the Developers: Hello! I have been following the progression of your game since very close to the beginning, and I must say it has come an impressively long way. There are still bugs to be worked out, and features you guys are }{atching (Pun Intended) but whilst moving into Beta, the game has received a well deserved amount of attention.Following the development, particularly the artwork sketches, the 3D design is quite aesthetically pleasing. Unfortunately, It must be said that the textures and colors applied could use a revamp. If feeling so inclined, perhaps a re-working of the textures would be admired, but falling short of that, many of your admiring players would enjoy a function to allow coloring of weapons. This functionality (if I understand your technology posts correctly) should not be all that far-fetched or far off to implement. It would allow for personality in our weapons, and for a more individually aesthetically pleasing experience.Yours sincerely,Bluefiremax"
177,feature,"yeah, that is pretty much the state of things as they are. Last I heard they were planning on working on environmentals for the next update, so hopefully that means more mobs and some balancing out of the biome size, as well as implementation of the smelter so we can make ingots.","That\\\'s putting it in a bit of a negative light, but sure, I guess.It\\\'s a sandbox. There aren\\\'t any clear objectives. You make it what you want to make of it.For me, building a decent base, no matter how irrelevant it may seem for you, is a fun and unique challenge for me. That is to say, the challenge lies in not in the gathering of resources or building the thing, but in making it appear as close to a real-life, serviceable structure as possible.","That\\\'s cool. Just because it\\\'s a sandbox game doesn\\\'t mean that you shouldn\\\'t expect more than painting dirt/wood walls to make your house. Ther\\\'es a creative mode and a survival mode, and I\\\'m describing survival mode, where surviving doesn\\\'t really require much in the way of a base. Until smelting is in, your current progress is needlessly turned into a grind, whereas other content comes much easier. Why be able to use a graphene drill to suck up 300 iron ore in a minute, but still have to kill little slugs to find iron ingots in low quantities? The vehicles looked interesting, but again require absurd amounts of ingots. My desire to grind slugs for a buggy in the game\\\'s current state is pretty limited, given that my experience with exploring the map has been less than positive. It looks very repetative and empty. Additionally it is pockmarked with these massive tunnel? cave? systems that amount to the ""surface"" being a super-thin layer of magical floating terrain with hard-to-see gaps leading to your death or a very long slog trying to find your way back up if you survive. It feels more like an alpha to me, and I expect there are going to be a number of map wipes as so many needed changes and features are added.. which is not typically what I expect in a beta."

Content and features are two different things. That is why I rarely say anything about content. Content is the medium which is used to experience features. Survival is not a feature but content in the game which allows you to use the features which are being worked in game now. Once dig is in everything will be in game to allow for a survival mode. Mobs, dig, build, resources, crafting are all the basic things you need really. If you need another example think about guns in a game.

What I was thinking was this-Gaining trust between each survivor, And once you have gain enough trust you can partner up!-If you have enough trust between survivers you can create a tribe! And the more survivors you get the bigger the tribe gets. And when you reach a certain level of survivors your tribe gts upgraded to like a village, then to a Settlement then to a town, Then to a City, Then to a civilization if you expand your boarders-Having war with another AI city or settlement or whatever because they denounced you or something! And a full scale relation system or diplomatic system-Having to take care of your city with the basic Resources Food, Water, Wood, Stone, Oil, Metal, Ect. And if you can not get all of these resources your fellow survivors will betray you and maybe kill you if it gets intense enough (Something like refusing to work or somethin) So you have to decide Are you a Solo Act?

When I said ""so much more"", I was referring to their other 30+ games and possible projects.Also, to answer your question as to whether or not they make games anymore, I couldn\\\'t tell you. They could be working on Half Life 3, L4D3, Portal 3, or anything else. As far as I am aware there aren\\\'t any announcements. They are making a lot of money off of CSGO, Dota 2, and TF2. It is easier to update those games (they are adding a competitve feature to TF2 I\\\'ve heard).My personal guess is that they are working on a game right now. Every game they have made recently has been a major success for them, they have no reason to stop. Anything they make from scratch could be better than picking up where Code}{atch abandoned us."
225,feature,"Jan 2, 2016 @ 8:28pm",easons you should NOT buy this,"1) it is a F***ing scam!2) You cant claim a refund3) It has NONE of the content shown on the store page4) the whole lot was ditched by the developers ages agoseriously, there is no one i hate more in this world than the people who made this pile of \\xe2\\x99\\xa5\\xe2\\x99\\xa5\\xe2\\x99\\xa5\\xe2\\x99\\xa5.flushing money down the toilet is 100x more satisfying than this garbage ""game"". I think everyone who supported this by buying it deserve a full refund, seeing as this whole game, was all of the lies from the developers and false promises, that was ""worked on"" for years never got out of its alpha stage and never delivered on the features shown and promised."
