I just could not handle Ultra, right? Nope. Even when setting everything to low, it still maintains 54-56 FPS. So clearly, a trouble with my CPU, right? Nope. My CPU utilization never exceeded 30% and checking the cores in task manager, none of them were particularly taxed as there were no cores that was maxed out.EDIT: Just to add, disabling VSYNC weirdly causes the framerates to crash to single digits.

Dont wonder about buggy campaign missions if you are using AI mods.GM campaign worked fine for me, too.@OP:Laws of War is the, imo, the best singleplayer campaign DLC you can get. But its not your typical Military Shooter stuff. And it has some pretty educational  scenarios. If you want more OG arma shooter feel go with Contact. It also has a great Campaign. With aliens though.If you want pure no-nonsense tactical military shooter gameplay go with GM or Tac-Ops. Both dont really have a ""Story"". more a setting and missions to play.

Knowing I didn\\\'t own the dlc, this was very odd, but curious, I wanted to see what it looked like. So I launched the map and it didn\\\'t immediately go into the loading screen like normal, it kind of took a second before actually going to the loading screen but then there I was, loaded into the map. I explored a lot of it before actually putting someone down and playing a scenario. As soon as i did that though, and clicked play scenario, I was loaded in for a mere 2 seconds before everything became really framey and then it kicked me out back to editor and brought up the error message ""Mission terminated because dlc content required"". I was wondering if this is a bug or simply a small change BI did so you could explore content before purchasing it.

This is not the fault of the server ops as they are given the DLC system and are using it as they see fit.BI will tell you that the system for DLC is so as not to divide the community but it is alienating those who may not be able to afford extra DLC and these people have to either choose not to use certain game modes/mods, and thus only getting half value from the FULL game they have purchased, or to put up with pop-ups/advertising.OK, so eventually, you learn which guns are DLC and which are ""normal"" but one of the biggest gripes I have is the fact you cannot even be a passenger in a DLC helicopter without getting bugged by the DLC sales pitch.  I can understand not being allowed to pilot a DLC heli, or be a gunner, but a passenger?Nobody is saying BI should not give people the ""option"" to purchase and download DLC stuff but the whole BI DCL system is a lazy, one size fits all, solution and it is, indeed, dividing the Arma 3 community by the way they have implemented it."

More often than not, it is operator error. I agree.An exception I think, is of buggy behavior in Zeus sometimes.

I\\\'m not sure if it qualifies as a ""bug"" unless it is repeatable.  More like some portion of your memory got corrupted.I use to experience all kinds of issues, not just AI problems either, when I only had 8 GB.  After I upgraded to 32 GB pretty much all those problems disappeared.  Arma III is a real memory hog, and 8 GB just barely cuts the mustard.I have gotten stuck in buildings before, but that was because they didn\\\'t conform to the maximum width and length, so the geometry LOD caused clipping and collision problems.

Very valid points. The moment one walks away from their mod, for whatever reason, it\\\'s on the clock and will eventually be too buggy for people to keep using. This won\\\'t stop when BI stops updating the game either, it\\\'ll stop when we all stop updating our own mods.Personally, I think modders should train or at least designate replacements for whenever they have to bow out. It\\\'s not something to look forward to, but things happen and the game cannot always be attended to. We should prepare for that, instead of letting so much content decay out of copyright fears."

They are typically ordering their AI to move into a solid object and then get mad when the AI fails to comply and they don\\\'t comprehend AI behavior or what it means to AI movement.There is nothing buggy about the AI.  It performs precisely as it was intended.  The problem comes in when users don\\\'t know how to use the AI properly because they don\\\'t understand the AI.  If you are trying to micro-manage your AI then you are causing your own problems.The AI in Arma III is more sophisticated and complex than any other military-style FPS and does not need micro-management.  The AI is capable of executing general instructions in a detailed manner.  Meaning that all that is required to move your AI team to a new location is to order them to move to the desired spot.  Allow the AI to determine the best means to get there based upon their current behavior.  Trying to micro-manage the AI and attempting to override their behavior will only cause problems.  A much better solution is to understand their behavior and what it means to their movement."

Vehicles, by default, allow you access.  However, they can be set up to be locked to players.If the vehicle is set up to allow access, then walk up to the vehicle until you are just a foot or two away.  Your mouse icon should change. If you see your mouse icon turn into a steering wheel, then you can access the vehicle as the Driver.  If you see your mouse icon turn into cross-hairs, then you can access the vehicle as the Gunner.  The other two positions with most other military vehicles are Commander and Passenger.  Obviously, civilian vehicles will not have a Gunner or Commander position for you to occupy.You make the selection by pressing the middle-mouse button (using the default settings).You can give your squad/team orders to mount a specific vehicle by selecting your squad/team using ""~"" and then ""4"" for Mount.  A list of available vehicles will appear.  Select the appropriate vehicle and then select the position you wish them to occupy in the vehicle."

What you could do about this is ban them from the server for 30 minutes straight if they teamkilled a lot in a limited time and with priority the guys that teamkill at base when is not being attacked.Second base camping. AIs can drive in death zones and can spawn camp you. This is super annoying as i have had multiple kamyshes push to our base while they are nowhere near to attacking it and just spawn kill everything. The AIs need to die in this zones too or just not be able to go there. People bring tigris with ammo vehicle and just destroy everyone that spawns killing the whole server off. There needs to be some kind of base godmode protectionThird sector scans lag/desync the players on the side that called the scan, and by this i mean you cannot open the menu for a long amount of time.Fourth vote kicking needs to be improved. People who have been on the server for a longer time than others should count their vote kicks a bit more. As this are the guys that usually don\\\'t want to ruin the game. OR lower the amount of vote kicks needed based on how many players are on, the more players on the harder to kick some griefer.  IF you manage to kick someone they can just rejoin even though you spent 15 minutes trying to get everyone to vote kick, there needs to be a temporary ban of ATLEAST 30 minutes.Fifth there is a bug in which you can spawn unlimited number of AIs as long as you have the CP to do it so, i do not want to talk about this here as people would start doing it i will try to find a place to send this bug report privately.Sixth setting up autonomous defenses at non super flat areas immediately destroys them as you place them down.Seventh end game. End game is borring and slow. Maybe ask the players if they want to surrender with a question box or etc. I know you can vote for restart but most of the players don\\\'t know how to do this and that they can do this. Also won\\\'t happen due to the fact that too many players need to vote.Eighth voting for sectors. Blufor always looses, the problem is that new people don\\\'t know how to join sides and just stick to blufor and when it comes to vote they vote for something that is not a good idea. To fix this problem count the votes from the players that have been in that game for longer more than the others. Usually the people that stick are the ones that really want to win the game and know what they are doing.Ninth Wrecks at airfields and griefers spawning in too many vehicles to stop people from being able to spawn jets and people buying jets at the same time. You should disable other people from buying a jet at that same airfield for a few dozen seconds atleast. And make sure vehicles don\\\'t paradrop ON the airfield.There are a lot of simple solutions to most of this problems and i as a programmer know they aren\\\'t hard to fix its just you guys need to pay attention to whats going on in this servers. Also hackers are a very big thing in warlords, haven\\\'t seen them as much the latest patch but that hasn\\\'t stopped them. The day the patch got released a hacker joined the server and covered up everyone\\\'s screen and left. Just please pay attention to what the players are experiencing it could go a long way. And this are just some of the issues i can think off currently for that gamemode i could think of a lot more, if anyone working for BI wants to add me and get more input feel free. Otherwise thanks for the game it is truly something to eat up all your free time and one of a kind game.Oh and if you wanna hire me for 350 euros a month i will work full time ;)"

Obviously this doesn\\\'t protect against d-bags who like to friendly fire because they can\\\'t be arsed to develop any skill at all, but I see new people get the wrong impression about this mode and sometimes the game in general --  and it\\\'s a crying shame!It\\\'s not just annoying to be on a team where you get FF\\\'d by your own side, but seeing the opposing team FF each other, takes away from the experience of having formidable opponents in, what I think, is a great (albeit vanilla) PVP experience.So press U and create a group, or join one by holding U when you get an invite in the game.End Rant."

127,feature,#4,"Jan 13, 2015 @ 12:33pm ","To be fair, the helicopter-DLC does not only adds a few new models, but a new ""Flight Simulator"" to the FPS-shooter ArmA3.There are still hundreds of models to download for free from the Community (yet!).All helicopters take advantage of the new flight model.If you can afford it and wants to support the Devs, you simply buy it.It also involves the continuous development of ArmA3 and the patches.Tbh I\\\'ve bought it because of the annoying popups.But it has given me the hope that the developers give the community more back,when they have earned the salaries for the team in the years after the release of ArmA3.The features of the DLCs are free, if you want to enter the helicopters as a crew-member you have to buy.But you can fly as a passenger in KotH and shoot out, which is a new feature from the DLC.Let\\\'s see what new features and restrictions comes with the marksman DLC.I would like to add, there is the possibility to put games on Steam on the wish list.You will be notified if there is a sale (the developers will also be notified by the number of customers).Originally posted by Cur:i cannot use the choppers nor can i even buy them (in koth) but even then, you think it\\\'s cool they forse me/us to have a ""log off"" time so they can advertise the DLC? i mean it\\\'s not like it\\\'s a free2play game... it is expensive enugh in it\\\'s base and i have no interest in neither the choppers nor the go kart\\\'s. what i do tho have an interest in is the game i bourght and payed for to work as it always did...

I doubt there\\\'s many players that want it to come back - probably not even the KotH/Wasteland crowd.Originally posted by SFWSv:And why jets has no more air to ground missile to destroy ground target?. AGMs are still here after Jets DLC. The DAGR, Macer/Macer II and Sharur/KH25 Kedge lock on via infrared so you need a heat signature on the target you want to lock onto. If they\\\'re ""cold"" then you won\\\'t get a lock on. I agree. The last thing we need are cheese features like the old system. The new sensors are much more flexible for mods as well."

Very valid points. The moment one walks away from their mod, for whatever reason, it\\\'s on the clock and will eventually be too buggy for people to keep using. This won\\\'t stop when BI stops updating the game either, it\\\'ll stop when we all stop updating our own mods.Personally, I think modders should train or at least designate replacements for whenever they have to bow out. It\\\'s not something to look forward to, but things happen and the game cannot always be attended to. We should prepare for that, instead of letting so much content decay out of copyright fears."

138,feature,#5,May 2 @ 6:48am ,"Perhaps the most important feature concerning the AI is its behavior.  Behavior will determine how the AI gets from point A to point B.  Not just the route they will take, but also how they travel.  There are five different behavior settings an AI can have:Careless \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Causes the AI to bunch up into a column.  Soldiers will walk slowly with the weapons in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9csafe\\xe2\\x80\\x9d position (lowered) and they will not switch to a more alert mode if the enemy is sighted.  However, vehicles in Careless mode will still fire at enemies.  All units will show a preference to sticking to the roads as much as possible when moving.  This behavior mode can cause some very unusual behavior in AI units on your team, and it is not recommended.  Use Safe mode instead.Safe \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Units will switch to Aware mode when the enemy is sighted, but otherwise behave similar to Careless above.Aware \\xe2\\x80\\x93 This is the default behavior mode.  Most units will still prefer to travel along the roads and vehicles will travel in convoy regardless of their current formation.  Infantry will stand upright and keep their weapon at the ready.  Infantry will also follow a road from the shoulder or nearby if possible, but not be directly on it.  Tracked vehicles will not use headlights, and will drive across any surface with no preference given to staying on roads.  Tracked vehicles will run over trees or bushes.  Air units will not use lights.  Communication is in a normal tone of voice.Combat \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Will cause the AI to start using bounding maneuvers.  Meaning, whenever they move it will be alternating from crouching to prone and move from cover to cover where possible.  When cover provides it, they will also crawl.  They will also call out sighting reports more often.  All lights are turned off, and no vehicle will use their lights.  All units will eject from vehicles that have been damaged.  AI being shot at will automatically go from Aware to Combat mode.  Communication is always shouting.Stealth \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Similar to Combat mode, but units will move even more cautiously, staying prone as much as possible.  If they have to move across open ground they will send a scout across first running as fast as possible.  Tracked vehicles will avoid knocking down trees.  Wheeled vehicles will follow the road, but no longer move as a convoy.  Communication is in the form of a loud whisper.Another aspect of AI behavior that cannot be directly controlled while playing is the morale of the AI.  The courage of an AI group is based upon the group leader\\\'s Courage skill.  If the group losses are higher than the initial strength multiplied by leader\\\'s Courage then the group will start fleeing.They will flee first to a friendly supply point, or if one cannot be found within a 600m radius of their location, they will try to find a safe position taking the distance and amount of available cover into account.Then there is AI Awareness, or knowsAbout value, which can alter an AI\\\'s behavior.  I\\\'ll save that for another time."
